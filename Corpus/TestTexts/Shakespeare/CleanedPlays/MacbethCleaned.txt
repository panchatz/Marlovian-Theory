 

. An open Place.



When shall we three meet again?

In thunder, lightning, or in rain?


When the hurlyburly’s done,

When the battle’s lost and won.


That will be ere the set of sun.


Where the place?


Upon the heath.


There to meet with Macbeth.


come, Graymalkin!


Paddock calls.


Anon.


Fair is foul, and foul is fair:

Hover through the fog and filthy air.


Camp near Forres.


Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.


What bloody man is that? He can report,

As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt

The newest state.


This is the sergeant

Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought

’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend!

Say to the King the knowledge of the broil

As thou didst leave it.


Doubtful it stood;

As two spent swimmers that do cling togethe
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald

(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that

The multiplying villainies of nature

Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles

Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;

And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,

Show’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;

For brave Macbeth ,

Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,

Which smok’d with bloody execution,

Like Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,

Till he fac’d the slave;

Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,

Till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,

And fix’d his head upon our battlements.


valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!


As whence the sun ’gins his reflection

Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,

So from that spring, whence comfort seem’d to come

Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:

No sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,

Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,

But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,

With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,

Began a fresh assault.


Dismay’d not this

Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?


Yes;

As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.

If  say sooth,  must report they were

As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;

So they

Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:

Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,

Or memorize another Golgotha,

cannot tell—

But  am faint, my gashes cry for help.


So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:

They smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons.



Who comes here?


The worthy Thane of Ross.


What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look

That seems to speak things strange.


God save the King!


Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?


From Fife, great King,

Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky

And fan our people cold.

Norway himself, with terrible numbers,

Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,

The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;

Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,

Confronted him with self-comparisons,

Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,

Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,

The victory fell on us.


Great happiness!


That now

Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;

Nor would we deign him burial of his men

Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch

Ten thousand dollars to our general use.


No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive

Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,

And with his former title greet Macbeth.

What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

Yet it shall be tempest-tost.

So foul and fair a day  have not seen.


How far is’t call’d to Forres?—What are these,

So wither’d, and so wild in their attire,

That look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earth,

And yet are on’t?—Live you? or are you aught

That man may question? You seem to understand me,

By each at once her choppy finger laying

Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,

And yet your beards forbid me to interpret

That you are so.


Speak, if you can;—what are you?


All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!


All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!


All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!


Good sir, why do you start and seem to fea
Things that do sound so fair?—’ th’ name of truth,

Are ye fantastical, or that indeed

Which outwardly ye show? My noble partne
You greet with present grace and great prediction

Of noble having and of royal hope,

That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.

If you can look into the seeds of time,

And say which grain will grow, and which will not,

Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fea
Your favours nor your hate.


Hail!


Hail!


Hail!


Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.


Not so happy, yet much happier.


Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:

So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!


Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!


Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.

By Sinel’s death  know  am Thane of Glamis;

But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,

prosperous gentleman; and to be king

Stands not within the prospect of belief,

No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence

You owe this strange intelligence? or why

Upon this blasted heath you stop our way

With such prophetic greeting?—Speak,  charge you.



The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,

And these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?


Into the air; and what seem’d corporal,

Melted as breath into the wind.

Would they had stay’d!


Were such things here as we do speak about?

Or have we eaten on the insane root

That takes the reason prisoner?


Your children shall be kings.


You shall be king.


And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?


To the selfsame tune and words. Who’s here?



The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth,

The news of thy success, and when he reads

Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,

His wonders and his praises do contend

Which should be thine or his: silenc’d with that,

In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day,

He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,

Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,

Strange images of death. As thick as tale

Came post with post; and everyone did bea
Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,

And pour’d them down before him.


We are sent

To give thee from our royal master thanks;

Only to herald thee into his sight,

Not pay thee.


And, for an earnest of a greater honour,

He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:

In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,

For it is thine.


What, can the devil speak true?


The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me

In borrow’d robes?


Who was the Thane lives yet,

But under heavy judgement bears that life

Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’d

With those of Norway, or did line the rebel

With hidden help and vantage, or that with both

He labour’d in his country’s wrack,  know not;

But treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,

Have overthrown him.


Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:

The greatest is behind.  Thanks for your pains.

Do you not hope your children shall be kings,

When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me

Promis’d no less to them?


That, trusted home,

Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,

Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange:

And oftentimes to win us to our harm,

The instruments of darkness tell us truths;

Win us with honest trifles, to betray’s

In deepest consequence.—

Cousins, a word,  pray you.


Two truths are told,

As happy prologues to the swelling act

Of the imperial theme.— thank you, gentlemen.—

This supernatural soliciting

Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,

Why hath it given me earnest of success,

Commencing in a truth?  am Thane of Cawdor:

If good, why do  yield to that suggestion

Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,

And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,

Against the use of nature? Present fears

Are less than horrible imaginings.

My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,

Shakes so my single state of man

That function is smother’d in surmise,

And nothing is but what is not.


Look, how our partner’s rapt.


If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me

Without my stir.


New honours come upon him,

Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould

But with the aid of use.


Come what come may,

Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.


Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.


Give me your favour. My dull brain was wrought

With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains

Are register’d where every day  turn

The leaf to read them.—Let us toward the King.—

Think upon what hath chanc’d; and at more time,

The interim having weigh’d it, let us speak

Our free hearts each to other.


Very gladly.


Till then, enough.—Come, friends.


Forres.  Room in the Palace.



Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not

Those in commission yet return’d?


My liege,

They are not yet come back. But  have spoke

With one that saw him die, who did report,

That very frankly he confess’d his treasons,

Implor’d your Highness’ pardon, and set forth

deep repentance. Nothing in his life

Became him like the leaving it; he died

As one that had been studied in his death,

To throw away the dearest thing he ow’d

As ’twere a careless trifle.


There’s no art

To find the mind’s construction in the face:

He was a gentleman on whom  built

An absolute trust.


worthiest cousin!

The sin of my ingratitude even now

Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,

That swiftest wing of recompense is slow

To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv’d;

That the proportion both of thanks and payment

Might have been mine! only  have left to say,

More is thy due than more than all can pay.


The service and the loyalty  owe,

In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness’ part

Is to receive our duties: and our duties

Are to your throne and state, children and servants;

Which do but what they should, by doing everything

Safe toward your love and honour.


Welcome hither:

have begun to plant thee, and will labou
To make thee full of growing.—Noble Banquo,

That hast no less deserv’d, nor must be known

No less to have done so, let me infold thee

And hold thee to my heart.


There if  grow,

The harvest is your own.


My plenteous joys,

Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves

In drops of sorrow.—Sons, kinsmen, thanes,

And you whose places are the nearest, know,

We will establish our estate upon

Our eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafte
The Prince of Cumberland: which honour must

Not unaccompanied invest him only,

But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine

On all deservers.—From hence to Inverness,

And bind us further to you.


The rest is labour, which is not us’d for you:

’ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful

The hearing of my wife with your approach;

So, humbly take my leave.


My worthy Cawdor!


The Prince of Cumberland!—That is a step

On which  must fall down, or else o’erleap,

For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!

Let not light see my black and deep desires.

The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,

Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.



True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;

And in his commendations  am fed.

It is a banquet to me. Let’s after him,

Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:

It is a peerless kinsman.


. Inverness.  Room in Macbeth’s Castle.



“They met me in the day of success; and  have learned by the

perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When 

burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,

into which they vanished. Whiles  stood rapt in the wonder of it, came

missives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which

title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the

coming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have  thought

good to deliver thee  that thou

might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what

greatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”

Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be

What thou art promis’d. Yet do  fear thy nature;

It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness

To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;

Art not without ambition, but without

The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,

That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,

And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have, great Glamis,

That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;

And that which rather thou dost fear to do,

Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,

That  may pour my spirits in thine ear,

And chastise with the valour of my tongue

All that impedes thee from the golden round,

Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem

To have thee crown’d withal.


What is your tidings?


The King comes here tonight.


Thou’rt mad to say it.

Is not thy master with him? who, were’t so,

Would have inform’d for preparation.


So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.

One of my fellows had the speed of him,

Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more

Than would make up his message.


Give him tending.

He brings great news.


The raven himself is hoarse

That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan

Under my battlements. Come, you spirits

That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,

And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full

Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood,

Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,

That no compunctious visitings of nature

Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between

Th’ effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts,

And take my milk for gall, your murd’ring ministers,

Wherever in your sightless substances

You wait on nature’s mischief! Come, thick night,

And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell

That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,

Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark

To cry, “Hold, hold!”


Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor!

Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!

Thy letters have transported me beyond

This ignorant present, and  feel now

The future in the instant.


My dearest love,

Duncan comes here tonight.


And when goes hence?


Tomorrow, as he purposes.


, neve
Shall sun that morrow see!

Your face, my thane, is as a book where men

May read strange matters. To beguile the time,

Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,

Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,

But be the serpent under’t. He that’s coming

Must be provided for; and you shall put

This night’s great business into my dispatch;

Which shall to all our nights and days to come

Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.


We will speak further.


Only look up clear;

To alter favour ever is to fear.

Leave all the rest to me.


The same. Before the Castle.

and Attendants.


This castle hath a pleasant seat. The ai
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself

Unto our gentle senses.


This guest of summer,

The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,

By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath

Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,

Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird

hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.

Where they most breed and haunt,  have observ’d

The air is delicate.



See, see, our honour’d hostess!—

The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,

Which still we thank as love. Herein  teach you

How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains,

And thank us for your trouble.


All our service,

In every point twice done, and then done double,

Were poor and single business to contend

Against those honours deep and broad wherewith

Your Majesty loads our house: for those of old,

And the late dignities heap’d up to them,

We rest your hermits.


Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?

We cours’d him at the heels, and had a purpose

To be his purveyor: but he rides well;

And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him

To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,

We are your guest tonight.


Your servants eve
Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,

To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure,

Still to return your own.


Give me your hand;

Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,

And shall continue our graces towards him.

By your leave, hostess.


The same.  Lobby in the Castle.


Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth.


If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well

It were done quickly. If th’ assassination

Could trammel up the consequence, and catch

With his surcease success; that but this blow

Might be the be-all and the end-all—here,

But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,

We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases

We still have judgement here; that we but teach

Bloody instructions, which being taught, return

To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice

Commends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice

To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:

First, as  am his kinsman and his subject,

Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,

Who should against his murderer shut the door,

Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan

Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been

So clear in his great office, that his virtues

Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against

The deep damnation of his taking-off;

And pity, like a naked new-born babe,

Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin, hors’d

Upon the sightless couriers of the air,

Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,

That tears shall drown the wind.— have no spu
To prick the sides of my intent, but only

Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself

And falls on th’ other—


How now! what news?


He has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?


Hath he ask’d for me?


Know you not he has?


We will proceed no further in this business:

He hath honour’d me of late; and  have bought

Golden opinions from all sorts of people,

Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,

Not cast aside so soon.


Was the hope drunk

Wherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?

And wakes it now, to look so green and pale

At what it did so freely? From this time

Such  account thy love. Art thou afeard

To be the same in thine own act and valou
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that

Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,

And live a coward in thine own esteem,

Letting “ dare not” wait upon “ would,”

Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?


Pr’ythee, peace!

Who dares do more is none.


What beast was’t, then,

That made you break this enterprise to me?

When you durst do it, then you were a man;

And, to be more than what you were, you would

Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place

Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:

They have made themselves, and that their fitness now

Does unmake you.  have given suck, and know

How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:

would, while it was smiling in my face,

Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums

And dash’d the brains out, had  so sworn as you

Have done to this.


If we should fail?


We fail?

But screw your courage to the sticking-place,

And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep

(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey

Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains

Will  with wine and wassail so convince

That memory, the warder of the brain,

Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason

limbeck only: when in swinish sleep

Their drenched natures lie as in a death,

What cannot you and  perform upon

Th’ unguarded Duncan? what not put upon

His spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt

Of our great quell?


Bring forth men-children only;

For thy undaunted mettle should compose

Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,

When we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two

Of his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,

That they have done’t?


Who dares receive it other,

As we shall make our griefs and clamour roa
Upon his death?

As this which now  draw.

Thou marshall’st me the way that  was going;

And such an instrument  was to use.

Mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses,

Or else worth all the rest:  see thee still;

And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,

Which was not so before.—There’s no such thing.

It is the bloody business which informs

Thus to mine eyes.—Now o’er the one half-world

Pale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murder,

Alarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,

Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,

With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design

Moves like a ghost.—Thou sure and firm-set earth,

Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fea
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,

And take the present horror from the time,

Which now suits with it.—Whiles  threat, he lives.

There’s one did laugh in’s sleep, and one cried, “Murder!”

That they did wake each other:  stood and heard them.

But they did say their prayers, and address’d them

Again to sleep.


There are two lodg’d together.


One cried, “God bless us!” and, “Amen,” the other,

As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.

List’ning their fear,  could not say “Amen,”

When they did say, “God bless us.”


Consider it not so deeply.


But wherefore could not  pronounce “Amen”?

Stuck in my throat.


These deeds must not be thought

After these ways; so, it will make us mad.


Methought  heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!

Macbeth does murder sleep,”—the innocent sleep;

Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,

The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath,

Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,

Chief nourisher in life’s feast.


What do you mean?


Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house:

“Glamis hath murder’d sleep, and therefore Cawdo
Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!”


Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,

You do unbend your noble strength to think

So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,

And wash this filthy witness from your hand.—

Why did you bring these daggers from the place?

They must lie there: go carry them, and smea
The sleepy grooms with blood.


’ll go no more:

am afraid to think what  have done;

Look on’t again  dare not.


Infirm of purpose!

Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead

Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood

That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,

’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,

For it must seem their guilt.



Whence is that knocking?

How is’t with me, when every noise appals me?

What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!

Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood

Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rathe
The multitudinous seas incarnadine,

Making the green one red.



My hands are of your color, but  shame

To wear a heart so white.   hear knocking

At the south entry:—retire we to our chamber.

little water clears us of this deed:

How easy is it then! Your constancy

Hath left you unattended.— Hark, more knocking.

Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us

And show us to be watchers. Be not lost

So poorly in your thoughts.


To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself. 

Wake Duncan with thy knocking!  would thou couldst!

Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should

have old turning the key.  Knock, knock, knock. Who’s

there, i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on

the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you;

here you’ll sweat for’t.  Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’

th’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swea
in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough

for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: , come in,

equivocator.  Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith,

here’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French

hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. 

Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold

for hell. ’ll devil-porter it no further:  had thought to have let in

some of all professions, that go the primrose way to th’ everlasting

bonfire.  Anon, anon!  pray you, remember the porter.




Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,

That you do lie so late?


Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is

a great provoker of three things.


What three things does drink especially provoke?


Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes

and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the

performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with

lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes

him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and

not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him

the lie, leaves him.


believe drink gave thee the lie last night.


That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but  requited him for his

lie; and  being too strong for him, though he took up my legs

sometime, yet  made a shift to cast him.


Is thy master stirring?


Our knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.


Good morrow, noble sir!


Good morrow, both!


Is the King stirring, worthy thane?


Not yet.


He did command me to call timely on him.

have almost slipp’d the hour.


’ll bring you to him.


know this is a joyful trouble to you;

But yet ’tis one.


The labour we delight in physics pain.

This is the door.


’ll make so bold to call.

For ’tis my limited service.



Goes the King hence today?


He does. He did appoint so.


The night has been unruly: where we lay,

Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,

Lamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death,

And prophesying, with accents terrible,

Of dire combustion and confus’d events,

New hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure bird

Clamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earth

Was feverous, and did shake.


’Twas a rough night.


My young remembrance cannot parallel

fellow to it.



horror, horror, horror!

Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!

, 

What’s the matter?


Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!

Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope

The Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence

The life o’ th’ building.


What is’t you say? the life?


Mean you his majesty?


Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight

With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.

See, and then speak yourselves.


Awake, awake!—

Ring the alarum bell.—Murder and treason!

Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!

Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit,

And look on death itself! Up, up, and see

The great doom’s image. Malcolm! Banquo!

As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites

To countenance this horror!




What’s the business,

That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley

The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!


gentle lady,

’Tis not for you to hear what  can speak:

The repetition, in a woman’s ear,

Would murder as it fell.


Banquo, Banquo!

Our royal master’s murder’d!


Woe, alas!

What, in our house?


Too cruel anywhere.—

Dear Duff,  pr’ythee, contradict thyself,

And say it is not so.



Had  but died an hour before this chance,

had liv’d a blessed time; for, from this instant

There’s nothing serious in mortality.

All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;

The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees

Is left this vault to brag of.



What is amiss?


You are, and do not know’t:

The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood

Is stopp’d; the very source of it is stopp’d.


Your royal father’s murder’d.


, by whom?


Those of his chamber, as it seem’d, had done’t:

Their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood;

So were their daggers, which, unwip’d, we found

Upon their pillows. They star’d, and were distracted;

No man’s life was to be trusted with them.


, yet  do repent me of my fury,

That  did kill them.


Wherefore did you so?


Who can be wise, amaz’d, temperate, and furious,

Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:

Th’ expedition of my violent love

Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,

His silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;

And his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature

For ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,

Steep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers

Unmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,

That had a heart to love, and in that heart

Courage to make’s love known?


Help me hence, ho!


Look to the lady.


Why do we hold our tongues,

That most may claim this argument for ours?


What should be spoken here, where our fate,

Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?

Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.


Nor our strong sorrow

Upon the foot of motion.


Look to the lady:—


And when we have our naked frailties hid,

That suffer in exposure, let us meet,

And question this most bloody piece of work

To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:

In the great hand of God  stand; and thence

Against the undivulg’d pretence  fight

Of treasonous malice.


And so do .


So all.


Let’s briefly put on manly readiness,

And meet i’ th’ hall together.


Well contented.



What will you do? Let’s not consort with them:

To show an unfelt sorrow is an office

Which the false man does easy. ’ll to England.


To Ireland, . Our separated fortune

Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,

There’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood,

The nearer bloody.


This murderous shaft that’s shot

Hath not yet lighted; and our safest way

Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;

And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,

But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft

Which steals itself, when there’s no mercy left.


The same. Without the Castle.



Threescore and ten  can remember well,

Within the volume of which time  have seen

Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night

Hath trifled former knowings.


Ha, good father,

Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act,

Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock ’tis day,

And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.

Is’t night’s predominance, or the day’s shame,

That darkness does the face of earth entomb,

When living light should kiss it?


’Tis unnatural,

Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last,

falcon, towering in her pride of place,

Was by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d.


And Duncan’s horses 

Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,

Turn’d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,

Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make

War with mankind.


’Tis said they eat each other.


They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes,

That look’d upon’t.

Here comes the good Macduff.


How goes the world, sir, now?


Why, see you not?


Is’t known who did this more than bloody deed?


Those that Macbeth hath slain.


Alas, the day!

What good could they pretend?


They were suborn’d.

Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons,

Are stol’n away and fled; which puts upon them

Suspicion of the deed.


’Gainst nature still:

Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up

Thine own life’s means!—Then ’tis most like

The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.


He is already nam’d; and gone to Scone

To be invested.


Where is Duncan’s body?


Carried to Colmekill,

The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,

And guardian of their bones.


Will you to Scone?


No, cousin, ’ll to Fife.


Well,  will thither.


Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu!

Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!


Farewell, father.


God’s benison go with you; and with those

That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!



. Forres.  Room in the Palace.



Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,

As the Weird Women promis’d; and,  fear,

Thou play’dst most foully for’t; yet it was said

It should not stand in thy posterity;

But that myself should be the root and fathe
Of many kings. If there come truth from them


Why, by the verities on thee made good,

May they not be my oracles as well,

And set me up in hope? But hush; no more.


Ross, Lords, and Attendants.


Here’s our chief guest.


If he had been forgotten,

It had been as a gap in our great feast,

And all-thing unbecoming.


Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,

And ’ll request your presence.


Let your Highness

Command upon me, to the which my duties

Are with a most indissoluble tie

For ever knit.


Ride you this afternoon?


Ay, my good lord.


We should have else desir’d your good advice


In this day’s council; but we’ll take tomorrow.

Is’t far you ride?


As far, my lord, as will fill up the time

’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,

must become a borrower of the night,

For a dark hour or twain.


Fail not our feast.


My lord,  will not.


We hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d

In England and in Ireland; not confessing

Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers

With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,

When therewithal we shall have cause of state

Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,

Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?


Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon’s.


wish your horses swift and sure of foot;

And so  do commend you to their backs.

Farewell.—


Let every man be master of his time

Till seven at night; to make society

The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself

Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you.


Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men

Our pleasure?


They are, my lord, without the palace gate.


Bring them before us.


To be thus is nothing,

But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo

Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature

Reigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares;

And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,

He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valou
To act in safety. There is none but he

Whose being  do fear: and under him

My genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said,

Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters

When first they put the name of king upon me,

And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,

They hail’d him father to a line of kings:

Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,

And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,

Thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,

No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,

For Banquo’s issue have  fil’d my mind;

For them the gracious Duncan have  murder’d;

Put rancours in the vessel of my peace

Only for them; and mine eternal jewel

Given to the common enemy of man,

To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!

Rather than so, come, fate, into the list,

And champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—


Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.


Was it not yesterday we spoke together?


It was, so please your Highness.


Well then, now

Have you consider’d of my speeches? Know

That it was he, in the times past, which held you

So under fortune, which you thought had been

Our innocent self? This  made good to you

In our last conference, pass’d in probation with you

How you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,

Who wrought with them, and all things else that might

To half a soul and to a notion craz’d

Say, “Thus did Banquo.”


You made it known to us.


did so; and went further, which is now

Our point of second meeting. Do you find

Your patience so predominant in your nature,

That you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,

To pray for this good man and for his issue,

Whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,

And beggar’d yours forever?


We are men, my liege.


Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;

As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,

Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept

All by the name of dogs: the valu’d file

Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,

The housekeeper, the hunter, every one

According to the gift which bounteous nature

Hath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive

Particular addition, from the bill

That writes them all alike: and so of men.

Now, if you have a station in the file,

Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;

And  will put that business in your bosoms,

Whose execution takes your enemy off,

Grapples you to the heart and love of us,

Who wear our health but sickly in his life,

Which in his death were perfect.


am one, my liege,

Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world

Hath so incens’d that  am reckless what

do to spite the world.


And  another,

So weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,

That  would set my life on any chance,

To mend it or be rid on’t.


Both of you

Know Banquo was your enemy.


True, my lord.


So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,

That every minute of his being thrusts

Against my near’st of life; and though  could

With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,

And bid my will avouch it, yet  must not,

For certain friends that are both his and mine,

Whose loves  may not drop, but wail his fall

Who  myself struck down: and thence it is

That  to your assistance do make love,

Masking the business from the common eye

For sundry weighty reasons.


We shall, my lord,

Perform what you command us.


Though our lives—


Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,

will advise you where to plant yourselves,

Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,

The moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight

And something from the palace; always thought

That  require a clearness. And with him


Fleance his son, that keeps him company,

Whose absence is no less material to me

Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate

Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.

’ll come to you anon.


We are resolv’d, my lord.


’ll call upon you straight: abide within.


It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,

If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.


The same. Another Room in the Palace.



Is Banquo gone from court?


Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.


Say to the King,  would attend his leisure

For a few words.


Madam,  will.



Naught’s had, all’s spent,

Where our desire is got without content:

’Tis safer to be that which we destroy,

Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.


How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,

Of sorriest fancies your companions making,

Using those thoughts which should indeed have died

With them they think on? Things without all remedy

Should be without regard: what’s done is done.


We have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it.

She’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice

Remains in danger of her former tooth.

But let the frame of things disjoint,

Both the worlds suffer,

Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep

In the affliction of these terrible dreams

That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,

Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,

Than on the torture of the mind to lie

In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;

After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;

Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,

Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing

Can touch him further.


Come on,

Gently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks;

Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.


So shall , love; and so,  pray, be you.

Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;

Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:

Unsafe the while, that we

Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,

And make our faces vizards to our hearts,

Disguising what they are.


You must leave this.


, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!

Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.


But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.


There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.

Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown

His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons

The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,

Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done

deed of dreadful note.


What’s to be done?


Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,

Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,

Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,

And with thy bloody and invisible hand

Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond

Which keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow

Makes wing to th’ rooky wood.

Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,

Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.

Thou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;

Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.

So, pr’ythee, go with me.


The same.  Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace.



But who did bid thee join with us?


Macbeth.


He needs not our mistrust; since he delivers

Our offices and what we have to do

To the direction just.


Then stand with us.

The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.

Now spurs the lated traveller apace,

To gain the timely inn; and near approaches

The subject of our watch.


Hark!  hear horses.


Give us a light there, ho!


Then ’tis he; the rest

That are within the note of expectation

Already are i’ th’ court.


His horses go about.


Almost a mile; but he does usually,

So all men do, from hence to the palace gate

Make it their walk.



light, a light!


’Tis he.


Stand to’t.


It will be rain tonight.


Let it come down.



, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!

Thou mayst revenge— slave!



Who did strike out the light?


Was’t not the way?


There’s but one down: the son is fled.


We have lost best half of our affair.


Well, let’s away, and say how much is done.


The same.  Room of state in the Palace.


and Attendants.


You know your own degrees, sit down. At first

And last the hearty welcome.


Thanks to your Majesty.


Ourself will mingle with society,

And play the humble host.

Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time,

We will require her welcome.


Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;

For my heart speaks they are welcome.



See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.

Both sides are even: here ’ll sit i’ th’ midst.

Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure

The table round. There’s blood upon thy face.


’Tis Banquo’s then.


’Tis better thee without than he within.

Is he dispatch’d?


My lord, his throat is cut. That  did for him.


Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;

Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:

If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.


Most royal sir,

Fleance is ’scap’d.


Then comes my fit again:  had else been perfect;

Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,

As broad and general as the casing air:

But now  am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in

To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?


Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,

With twenty trenched gashes on his head;

The least a death to nature.


Thanks for that.

There the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled

Hath nature that in time will venom breed,

No teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow

We’ll hear, ourselves, again.



My royal lord,

You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold

That is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,

’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;

From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;

Meeting were bare without it.

The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth’s place.


Sweet remembrancer!—

Now, good digestion wait on appetite,

And health on both!


May’t please your Highness sit.


Here had we now our country’s honour roof’d,

Were the grac’d person of our Banquo present;

Who may  rather challenge for unkindness

Than pity for mischance!


His absence, sir,

Lays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness

To grace us with your royal company?


The table’s full.


Here is a place reserv’d, sir.


Where?


Here, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?


Which of you have done this?


What, my good lord?


Thou canst not say  did it. Never shake

Thy gory locks at me.


Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.


Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,

And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;

The fit is momentary; upon a thought

He will again be well. If much you note him,

You shall offend him, and extend his passion.

Feed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?


Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that

Which might appal the devil.


proper stuff!

This is the very painting of your fear:

This is the air-drawn dagger which you said,

Led you to Duncan. , these flaws, and starts

, would well become

woman’s story at a winter’s fire,

Authoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself!

Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,

You look but on a stool.


Pr’ythee, see there!

Behold! look! lo! how say you?

Why, what care ? If thou canst nod, speak too.—

If charnel houses and our graves must send

Those that we bury back, our monuments

Shall be the maws of kites.



What, quite unmann’d in folly?


If  stand here,  saw him.


Fie, for shame!


Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,

Ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;

Ay, and since too, murders have been perform’d

Too terrible for the ear: the time has been,

That, when the brains were out, the man would die,

And there an end; but now they rise again,

With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,

And push us from our stools. This is more strange

Than such a murder is.


My worthy lord,

Your noble friends do lack you.


do forget.—

Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.

have a strange infirmity, which is nothing

To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;

Then ’ll sit down.—Give me some wine, fill full.—

drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table,

And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss:

Would he were here.

Ghost rises again.

To all, and him, we thirst,

And all to all.


Our duties, and the pledge.


Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!

Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;

Thou hast no speculation in those eyes

Which thou dost glare with!


Think of this, good peers,

But as a thing of custom: ’tis no other,

Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.


What man dare,  dare:

Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,

The arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger;

Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves

Shall never tremble: or be alive again,

And dare me to the desert with thy sword;

If trembling  inhabit then, protest me

The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!

Unreal mock’ry, hence!


Why, so;—being gone,

am a man again.—Pray you, sit still.


You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting

With most admir’d disorder.


Can such things be,

And overcome us like a summer’s cloud,

Without our special wonder? You make me strange

Even to the disposition that  owe,

When now  think you can behold such sights,

And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,

When mine are blanch’d with fear.


What sights, my lord?


pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;

Question enrages him. At once, good night:—

Stand not upon the order of your going,

But go at once.


Good night; and better health

Attend his Majesty!


kind good night to all!



It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood.

Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak;

Augurs, and understood relations, have

By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth

The secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?


Almost at odds with morning, which is which.


How say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person

At our great bidding?


Did you send to him, sir?


hear it by the way; but  will send.

There’s not a one of them but in his house

keep a servant fee’d.  will tomorrow

to the Weird Sisters:

More shall they speak; for now  am bent to know,

By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,

All causes shall give way:  am in blood

Stepp’d in so far that, should  wade no more,

Returning were as tedious as go o’er.

Strange things  have in head, that will to hand,

Which must be acted ere they may be scann’d.


You lack the season of all natures, sleep.


Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse

Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.

We are yet but young in deed.


. The heath.



Why, how now, Hecate? you look angerly.


Have  not reason, beldams as you are,

Saucy and overbold? How did you dare

To trade and traffic with Macbeth

In riddles and affairs of death;

And , the mistress of your charms,

The close contriver of all harms,

Was never call’d to bear my part,

Or show the glory of our art?

And, which is worse, all you have done

Hath been but for a wayward son,

Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,

Loves for his own ends, not for you.

But make amends now: get you gone,

And at the pit of Acheron

Meet me i’ th’ morning: thither he

Will come to know his destiny.

Your vessels and your spells provide,

Your charms, and everything beside.

am for th’ air; this night ’ll spend

Unto a dismal and a fatal end.

Great business must be wrought ere noon.

Upon the corner of the moon

There hangs a vap’rous drop profound;

’ll catch it ere it come to ground:

And that, distill’d by magic sleights,

Shall raise such artificial sprites,

As, by the strength of their illusion,

Shall draw him on to his confusion.

He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bea
His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear.

And you all know, security

Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.


Hark!  am call’d; my little spirit, see,

Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.



Come, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again.


Forres.  Room in the Palace.



My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,

Which can interpret farther: only,  say,

Thing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan

Was pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:—

And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late;

Whom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d,

For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.

Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous

It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain

To kill their gracious father? damned fact!

How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,

In pious rage, the two delinquents tea
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?

Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;

For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive,

To hear the men deny’t. So that,  say,

He has borne all things well: and  do think,

That had he Duncan’s sons under his key

they should find

What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.

But, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d

His presence at the tyrant’s feast,  hear,

Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell

Where he bestows himself?


The son of Duncan,

From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,

Lives in the English court and is receiv’d

Of the most pious Edward with such grace

That the malevolence of fortune nothing

Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff

Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid

To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward

That, by the help of these (with Him above

To ratify the work), we may again

Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;

Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,

Do faithful homage, and receive free honours,

All which we pine for now. And this report

Hath so exasperate the King that he

Prepares for some attempt of war.


Sent he to Macduff?


He did: and with an absolute “Sir, not ,”

The cloudy messenger turns me his back,

And hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time

That clogs me with this answer.”


And that well might

Advise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance

His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel

Fly to the court of England, and unfold

His message ere he come, that a swift blessing

May soon return to this our suffering country

Under a hand accurs’d!


’ll send my prayers with him.



.  dark Cave. In the middle, a Cauldron Boiling.



Thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d.


Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whin’d.


Harpier cries:—’Tis time, ’tis time.


Round about the cauldron go;

In the poison’d entrails throw.—

Toad, that under cold stone

Days and nights has thirty-one

Swelter’d venom sleeping got,

Boil thou first i’ th’ charmed pot!


Double, double, toil and trouble;

Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.


Fillet of a fenny snake,

In the cauldron boil and bake;

Eye of newt, and toe of frog,

Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,

Adder’s fork, and blind-worm’s sting,

Lizard’s leg, and howlet’s wing,

For a charm of powerful trouble,

Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.


Double, double, toil and trouble;

Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.


Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,

Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf

Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark,

Root of hemlock digg’d i’ th’ dark,

Liver of blaspheming Jew,

Gall of goat, and slips of yew

Sliver’d in the moon’s eclipse,

Nose of Turk, and Tartar’s lips,

Finger of birth-strangled babe

Ditch-deliver’d by a drab,

Make the gruel thick and slab:

Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron,

For th’ ingredients of our cauldron.


Double, double, toil and trouble;

Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.


Cool it with a baboon’s blood.

Then the charm is firm and good.



, well done!  commend your pains,

And everyone shall share i’ th’ gains.

And now about the cauldron sing,

Like elves and fairies in a ring,

Enchanting all that you put in.




By the pricking of my thumbs,

Something wicked this way comes.

Open, locks,

Whoever knocks!



How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!

What is’t you do?

conjure you, by that which you profess,

answer me:

Though you untie the winds, and let them fight

Against the churches; though the yesty waves

Confound and swallow navigation up;

Though bladed corn be lodg’d, and trees blown down;

Though castles topple on their warders’ heads;

Though palaces and pyramids do slope

Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure

Of nature’s germens tumble all together,

Even till destruction sicken, answer me

To what  ask you.


Speak.


Demand.


We’ll answer.


Say, if thou’dst rather hear it from our mouths,

Or from our masters?


Call ’em, let me see ’em.


Pour in sow’s blood, that hath eaten

Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten

From the murderer’s gibbet throw

Into the flame.


Come, high or low;

Thyself and office deftly show!



Tell me, thou unknown power,—


He knows thy thought:

Hear his speech, but say thou naught.


Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff;

Beware the Thane of Fife.—Dismiss me.—Enough.



Whate’er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;

Thou hast harp’d my fear aright.—But one word more.


He will not be commanded. Here’s another,

More potent than the first.



Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!


Had  three ears, ’d hear thee.


Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn

The power of man, for none of woman born

Shall harm Macbeth.



Then live, Macduff: what need  fear of thee?

But yet ’ll make assurance double sure,

And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live;

That  may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,

And sleep in spite of thunder.

[_Thunder. An Apparition of a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand,

rises._]

What is this,

That rises like the issue of a king,

And wears upon his baby brow the round

And top of sovereignty?


Listen, but speak not to’t.


Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care

Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:

Macbeth shall never vanquish’d be, until

Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill

Shall come against him.



That will never be:

Who can impress the forest; bid the tree

Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements, good!

Rebellious head, rise never till the wood

Of Birnam rise, and our high-plac’d Macbeth

Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath

To time and mortal custom.—Yet my heart

Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art

Can tell so much, shall Banquo’s issue eve
Reign in this kingdom?


Seek to know no more.

And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.

Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?



Show!


Show!


Show!


Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;

Come like shadows, so depart!

[_A show of eight kings appear, and pass over in order, the last with

a glass in his hand; Banquo following._]


Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo. Down!

Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs:—and thy hair,

Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.

third is like the former.—Filthy hags!

Why do you show me this?— fourth!—Start, eyes!

What, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom?

Another yet!— seventh!—’ll see no more:—

And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass

Which shows me many more; and some  see

That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.

Horrible sight!—Now  see ’tis true;

For the blood-bolter’d Banquo smiles upon me,

And points at them for his.—What! is this so?


Ay, sir, all this is so:—but why

Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?—

Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,

And show the best of our delights.

While you perform your antic round;

That this great king may kindly say,

Our duties did his welcome pay.



Where are they? Gone?—Let this pernicious hou
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!—

Come in, without there!



What’s your Grace’s will?


Saw you the Weird Sisters?


No, my lord.


Came they not by you?


No, indeed, my lord.


Infected be the air whereon they ride;

And damn’d all those that trust them!— did hea
The galloping of horse: who was’t came by?


’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word

Macduff is fled to England.


Fled to England!


Ay, my good lord.


Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits:

The flighty purpose never is o’ertook

Unless the deed go with it. From this moment

The very firstlings of my heart shall be

The firstlings of my hand. And even now,

To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:

The castle of Macduff  will surprise;

Seize upon Fife; give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword

His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls

That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;

This deed ’ll do before this purpose cool:

But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?

Come, bring me where they are.


Fife.  Room in Macduff’s Castle.



What had he done, to make him fly the land?


You must have patience, madam.


He had none:

His flight was madness: when our actions do not,

Our fears do make us traitors.


You know not

Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.


Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,

His mansion, and his titles, in a place

From whence himself does fly? He loves us not:

He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,

The most diminutive of birds, will fight,

Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.

All is the fear, and nothing is the love;

As little is the wisdom, where the flight

So runs against all reason.


My dearest coz,

pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband,

He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows

The fits o’ th’ season.  dare not speak much further:

But cruel are the times, when we are traitors,

And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumou
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,

But float upon a wild and violent sea

Each way and move— take my leave of you:

Shall not be long but ’ll be here again.

Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward

To what they were before.—My pretty cousin,

Blessing upon you!


Father’d he is, and yet he’s fatherless.

It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:

Sirrah, your father’s dead.

And what will you do now? How will you live?


As birds do, mother.


What, with worms and flies?


With what  get,  mean; and so do they.


Poor bird! thou’dst never fear the net nor lime,

The pit-fall nor the gin.


Why should , mother? Poor birds they are not set for.

My father is not dead, for all your saying.


Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?


Nay, how will you do for a husband?


Why,  can buy me twenty at any market.


Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.


Thou speak’st with all thy wit;

And yet, i’ faith, with wit enough for thee.


Was my father a traitor, mother?


Ay, that he was.


What is a traitor?


Why, one that swears and lies.


And be all traitors that do so?


Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.


And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?


Every one.


Who must hang them?


Why, the honest men.


Then the liars and swearers are fools: for there are liars and swearers

enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.


Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?


If he were dead, you’ld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good

sign that  should quickly have a new father.


Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!

Though in your state of honour  am perfect.

If you will take a homely man’s advice,

Let us seek out some desolate shade and there

Weep our sad bosoms empty.


Let us rathe
Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,

Bestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new morn

New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows

Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds

As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out

Like syllable of dolour.


What  believe, ’ll wail;

What know, believe; and what  can redress,

As  shall find the time to friend,  will.

Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,

For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;

The title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:

And here, from gracious England, have  offe
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,

When  shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,

Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country

Shall have more vices than it had before,

More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,

By him that shall succeed.

It is myself  mean; in whom  know

Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d

In evils to top Macbeth.


grant him bloody,

Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,

Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin

That has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,

In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,

Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up

The cistern of my lust; and my desire

All continent impediments would o’erbear,

That did oppose my will: better Macbeth

Than such an one to reign.


Boundless intemperance

In nature is a tyranny; it hath been

Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,

And fall of many kings. But fear not yet

To take upon you what is yours: you may

Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,

And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.

We have willing dames enough; there cannot be

That vulture in you, to devour so many

As will to greatness dedicate themselves,

Finding it so inclin’d.


With this there grows

In my most ill-compos’d affection such

staunchless avarice, that, were  king,

should cut off the nobles for their lands;

Desire his jewels, and this other’s house:

And my more-having would be as a sauce

To make me hunger more; that  should forge

Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,

Destroying them for wealth.


This avarice

Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root

Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been

The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;

Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,

Of your mere own. All these are portable,

With other graces weigh’d.


But  have none: the king-becoming graces,

As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,

Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,

Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,

have no relish of them; but abound

In the division of each several crime,

Acting it many ways. Nay, had  power,  should

Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,

Uproar the universal peace, confound

All unity on earth.


Scotland, Scotland!


If such a one be fit to govern, speak:

am as  have spoken.


Fit to govern?

No, not to live.— nation miserable,

With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,

When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,

Since that the truest issue of thy throne

By his own interdiction stands accus’d,

And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal fathe
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,

Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,

Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!

These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself

Have banish’d me from Scotland.— my breast,

Thy hope ends here!


Macduff, this noble passion,

Child of integrity, hath from my soul

Wiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts

To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth

By many of these trains hath sought to win me

Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me

From over-credulous haste: but God above

Deal between thee and me! for even now

put myself to thy direction, and

Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure

The taints and blames  laid upon myself,

For strangers to my nature.  am yet

Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;

Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;

At no time broke my faith; would not betray

The devil to his fellow; and delight

No less in truth than life: my first false speaking

Was this upon myself. What  am truly,

Is thine and my poor country’s to command:

Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,

Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,

Already at a point, was setting forth.

Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness

Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?


Such welcome and unwelcome things at once

’Tis hard to reconcile.



Well; more anon.—Comes the King forth,  pray you?


Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls

That stay his cure: their malady convinces

The great assay of art; but at his touch,

Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,

They presently amend.

What’s the disease he means?


’Tis call’d the evil:

most miraculous work in this good king;

Which often, since my here-remain in England,

have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,

Himself best knows, but strangely-visited people,

All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,

The mere despair of surgery, he cures;

Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,

Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,

To the succeeding royalty he leaves

The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,

He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;

And sundry blessings hang about his throne,

That speak him full of grace.



See, who comes here?


My countryman; but yet  know him not.


My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

The means that makes us strangers!


Sir, amen.


Stands Scotland where it did?


Alas, poor country,

Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot

Be call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,

But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;

Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,

Are made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems

modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell

Is there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives

Expire before the flowers in their caps,

Dying or ere they sicken.

Too nice, and yet too true!


What’s the newest grief?


That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;

Each minute teems a new one.


How does my wife?


Why, well.


And all my children?


Well too.


The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?


No; they were well at peace when  did leave ’em.


Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?


When  came hither to transport the tidings,

Which  have heavily borne, there ran a rumou
Of many worthy fellows that were out;

Which was to my belief witness’d the rather,

For that  saw the tyrant’s power afoot.

Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland

Would create soldiers, make our women fight,

To doff their dire distresses.


Be’t their comfort

We are coming thither. Gracious England hath

Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;

An older and a better soldier none

That Christendom gives out.


Would  could answe
This comfort with the like! But  have words

That would be howl’d out in the desert air,

Where hearing should not latch them.


What concern they?

The general cause? or is it a fee-grief

Due to some single breast?


No mind that’s honest

But in it shares some woe, though the main part

Pertains to you alone.


If it be mine,

Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.


Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,

Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound

That ever yet they heard.


Humh!  guess at it.


Your castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes

Savagely slaughter’d. To relate the manne

To add the death of you.


Merciful heaven!—

What, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.

Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak

Whispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.

And  must be from thence!

But  must also feel it as a man:

cannot but remember such things were,

That were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,

And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,

They were all struck for thee! Naught that  am,

Not for their own demerits, but for mine,

Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!


Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief

Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

And braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens,

Cut short all intermission; front to front,

Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;

Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,

Heaven forgive him too!


This tune goes manly.

Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;

Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth

Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;

Good night, good doctor.

The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,

His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.

Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes

Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm

Excite the mortified man.


Near Birnam wood

Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.


Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?


For certain, sir, he is not.  have a file

Of all the gentry: there is Siward’s son

And many unrough youths, that even now

Protest their first of manhood.


What does the tyrant?


Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

Some say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him,

Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,

He cannot buckle his distemper’d cause

Within the belt of rule.


Now does he feel

His secret murders sticking on his hands;

Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;

Those he commands move only in command,

Nothing in love: now does he feel his title

Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe

Upon a dwarfish thief.


Who, then, shall blame

His pester’d senses to recoil and start,

When all that is within him does condemn

Itself for being there?


Well, march we on,

To give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d:

Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal;

And with him pour we, in our country’s purge,

Each drop of us.


Or so much as it needs

To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.

And that which should accompany old age,

Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.

That keep her from her rest.


Cure her of that:

Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,

Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,

Raze out the written troubles of the brain,

And with some sweet oblivious antidote

Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff

Which weighs upon the heart?

And purge it to a sound and pristine health,

That should applaud again.—Pull’t off,  say.—

What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,

Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them?


Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation

Makes us hear something.


Bring it after me.—

will not be afraid of death and bane,

Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.



Were  from Dunsinane away and clear,

Profit again should hardly draw me here.


Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.


Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching.


Cousins,  hope the days are near at hand

That chambers will be safe.


We doubt it nothing.


What wood is this before us?


The wood of Birnam.


Let every soldier hew him down a bough,

And bear’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow

The numbers of our host, and make discovery

Err in report of us.


It shall be done.


We learn no other but the confident tyrant

Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure

Our setting down before’t.


’Tis his main hope;

For where there is advantage to be given,

Both more and less have given him the revolt,

And none serve with him but constrained things,

Whose hearts are absent too.


Let our just censures

Attend the true event, and put we on

Industrious soldiership.


The time approaches,

That will with due decision make us know

What we shall say we have, and what we owe.

Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,

But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;

Towards which advance the war.


. Dunsinane. Within the castle.



Hang out our banners on the outward walls;

The cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength

Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie

Till famine and the ague eat them up.

Were they not forc’d with those that should be ours,

We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,

And beat them backward home.


What is that noise?


It is the cry of women, my good lord.



have almost forgot the taste of fears.

The time has been, my senses would have cool’d

To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hai
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and sti
As life were in’t.  have supp’d full with horrors;

Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,

Cannot once start me.


Wherefore was that cry?


The Queen, my lord, is dead.


She should have died hereafter.

There would have been a time for such a word.

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,

To the last syllable of recorded time;

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

Life’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,

That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,

And then is heard no more: it is a tale

Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

Signifying nothing.


Thou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.


Gracious my lord,

should report that which  say  saw,

But know not how to do’t.


Well, say, sir.


As  did stand my watch upon the hill,

look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,

The wood began to move.


Liar, and slave!


Let me endure your wrath, if’t be not so.

Within this three mile may you see it coming;

say, a moving grove.


If thou speak’st false,

Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,

Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,

care not if thou dost for me as much.—

pull in resolution; and begin

To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,

That lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood

Do come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood

Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—

If this which he avouches does appear,

There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.

’gin to be aweary of the sun,

And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—

Ring the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!

At least we’ll die with harness on our back.


The same.  Plain before the Castle.


Army, with boughs.


Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down,

And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,

Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,

Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we

Shall take upon’s what else remains to do,

According to our order.


Fare you well.—

Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,

Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.


Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,

Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.


The same. Another part of the Plain.



They have tied me to a stake.  cannot fly,

But, bear-like  must fight the course.—What’s he

That was not born of woman? Such a one

Am  to fear, or none.



What is thy name?


Thou’lt be afraid to hear it.


No; though thou call’st thyself a hotter name

Than any is in hell.


My name’s Macbeth.


The devil himself could not pronounce a title

More hateful to mine ear.


No, nor more fearful.


Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword

’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.



Thou wast born of woman.

But swords  smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,

Brandish’d by man that’s of a woman born.




That way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face!

If thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mine,

My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.

cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms

Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,

Or else my sword, with an unbatter’d edge,

sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;

By this great clatter, one of greatest note

Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!

And more  beg not.




This way, my lord;—the castle’s gently render’d:

The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight;

The noble thanes do bravely in the war,

The day almost itself professes yours,

And little is to do.


We have met with foes

That strike beside us.




The same. Another part of the field.



Why should  play the Roman fool, and die

On mine own sword? whiles  see lives, the gashes

Do better upon them.



Turn, hell-hound, turn!


Of all men else  have avoided thee:

But get thee back; my soul is too much charg’d

With blood of thine already.


have no words;

My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain

Than terms can give thee out!



Thou losest labour:

As easy mayst thou the intrenchant ai
With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed:

Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;

bear a charmed life, which must not yield

To one of woman born.


Despair thy charm;

And let the angel whom thou still hast serv’d

Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb

Untimely ripp’d.


Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,

For it hath cow’d my better part of man!

And be these juggling fiends no more believ’d,

That palter with us in a double sense;

That keep the word of promise to our ear,

And break it to our hope!—’ll not fight with thee.


Then yield thee, coward,

And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.

We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,

Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,

“Here may you see the tyrant.”


will not yield,

To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet,

And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.

Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,

And thou oppos’d, being of no woman born,

Yet  will try the last. Before my body

throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;

And damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!”



Ross, Thanes and Soldiers.


would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d.


Some must go off; and yet, by these  see,

So great a day as this is cheaply bought.


Macduff is missing, and your noble son.


Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt:

He only liv’d but till he was a man;

The which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d

In the unshrinking station where he fought,

But like a man he died.


Then he is dead?


Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow

Must not be measur’d by his worth, for then

It hath no end.


Had he his hurts before?


Ay, on the front.


Why then, God’s soldier be he!

Had  as many sons as  have hairs,

would not wish them to a fairer death:

And so his knell is knoll’d.


He’s worth more sorrow,

And that ’ll spend for him.


He’s worth no more.

They say he parted well and paid his score:

And so, God be with him!—Here comes newer comfort.



Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands

Th’ usurper’s cursed head: the time is free.

see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearl,

That speak my salutation in their minds;

Whose voices  desire aloud with mine,—

Hail, King of Scotland!


Hail, King of Scotland!



We shall not spend a large expense of time

Before we reckon with your several loves,

And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,

Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland

In such an honour nam’d. What’s more to do,

Which would be planted newly with the time,—

As calling home our exil’d friends abroad,

That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;

Producing forth the cruel ministers

Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen,

Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands

Took off her life;—this, and what needful else

That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,

We will perform in measure, time, and place.

So thanks to all at once, and to each one,

Whom we invite to see us crown’d at Scone.
