Tush, never tell me,  take it much unkindly

That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,

As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.


’Sblood, but you will not hear me.

If ever  did dream of such a matter,

Abhor me.


Thou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.


Despise me if  do not. Three great ones of the city,

In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,

Off-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man,

know my price,  am worth no worse a place.

But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,

Evades them, with a bombast circumstance,

Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war:

And in conclusion,

Nonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he,

“ have already chose my officer.”

And what was he?

Forsooth, a great arithmetician,

One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,

fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife,

That never set a squadron in the field,

Nor the division of a battle knows

More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,

Wherein the toged consuls can propose

As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice

Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,

And , of whom his eyes had seen the proof

At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,

Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d

By debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,

He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,

And , God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.


By heaven,  rather would have been his hangman.


Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service,

Preferment goes by letter and affection,

And not by old gradation, where each second

Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself

Whether  in any just term am affin’d

To love the Moor.


would not follow him, then.


, sir, content you.

follow him to serve my turn upon him:

We cannot all be masters, nor all masters

Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark

Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave

That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,

Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,

For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.

Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are

Who, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty,

Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,

And throwing but shows of service on their lords,

Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats,

Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,

And such a one do  profess myself. For, sir,

It is as sure as you are Roderigo,

Were  the Moor,  would not be Iago:

In following him,  follow but myself.

Heaven is my judge, not  for love and duty,

But seeming so for my peculiar end.

For when my outward action doth demonstrate

The native act and figure of my heart

In complement extern, ’tis not long afte
But  will wear my heart upon my sleeve

For daws to peck at:  am not what  am.


What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,

If he can carry’t thus!


Call up her father,

Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,

Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,

And though he in a fertile climate dwell,

Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,

Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t,

As it may lose some color.


Here is her father’s house, ’ll call aloud.


Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell

As when, by night and negligence, the fire

Is spied in populous cities.


What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!


Awake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!

Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!

Thieves, thieves!

Brabantio appears above at a window.


What is the reason of this terrible summons?

What is the matter there?


Signior, is all your family within?


Are your doors locked?


Why, wherefore ask you this?


Zounds, sir, you’re robb’d, for shame put on your gown,

Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;

Even now, now, very now, an old black ram

Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,

Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,

Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:

Arise,  say.


What, have you lost your wits?


Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?


Not . What are you?


My name is Roderigo.


The worser welcome.

have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors;

In honest plainness thou hast heard me say

My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,

Being full of supper and distempering draughts,

Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come

To start my quiet.


Sir, sir, sir,—


But thou must needs be sure

My spirit and my place have in them powe
To make this bitter to thee.


Patience, good sir.


What tell’st thou me of robbing?

This is Venice. My house is not a grange.


Most grave Brabantio,

In simple and pure soul  come to you.


Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil

bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are

ruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse;

you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins

and gennets for germans.


What profane wretch art thou?


am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are

now making the beast with two backs.


Thou art a villain.


You are a senator.


This thou shalt answer.  know thee, Roderigo.


Sir,  will answer anything. But  beseech you,

If ’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,

that your fair daughter,

At this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,

Transported with no worse nor better guard,

But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,

To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:

If this be known to you, and your allowance,

We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.

But if you know not this, my manners tell me,

We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe

That from the sense of all civility,

thus would play and trifle with your reverence.

Your daughte
say again, hath made a gross revolt,

Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes

In an extravagant and wheeling strange
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:

If she be in her chamber or your house,

Let loose on me the justice of the state

For thus deluding you.


Strike on the tinder, ho!

Give me a taper! Call up all my people!

This accident is not unlike my dream,

Belief of it oppresses me already.

Light,  say, light!



Farewell; for  must leave you:

It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place

To be produc’d, as if  stay  shall,

Against the Moor. For  do know the state,

However this may gall him with some check,

Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d

With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,

Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,

Another of his fathom they have none

To lead their business. In which regard,

Though  do hate him as  do hell pains,

Yet, for necessity of present life,

must show out a flag and sign of love,

Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,

Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,

And there will  be with him. So, farewell.




It is too true an evil. Gone she is,

And what’s to come of my despised time,

Is naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo,

Where didst thou see her? 

With the Moor, say’st thou? 

How didst thou know ’twas she? (, she deceives me

Past thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers,

Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?


Truly  think they are.


heaven! How got she out?  treason of the blood!

Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds

By what you see them act. Is there not charms

By which the property of youth and maidhood

May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,

Of some such thing?


Yes, sir,  have indeed.


Call up my brother. , would you had had her!

Some one way, some another. Do you know

Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?


think  can discover him, if you please

To get good guard, and go along with me.


Pray you lead on. At every house ’ll call,

may command at most. Get weapons, ho!

And raise some special officers of night.

On, good Roderigo.  will deserve your pains.


Venice. Another street.



Though in the trade of war  have slain men,

Yet do  hold it very stuff o’ the conscience

To do no contriv’d murder;  lack iniquity

Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times

had thought to have yerk’d him here under the ribs.


’Tis better as it is.


Nay, but he prated,

And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms

Against your honour,

That with the little godliness  have,

did full hard forbear him. But  pray you, sir,

Are you fast married? Be assur’d of this,

That the magnifico is much belov’d

And hath in his effect a voice potential

As double as the duke’s; he will divorce you,

Or put upon you what restraint and grievance

The law 

Will give him cable.


Let him do his spite;

My services, which  have done the signiory,

Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know,—

Which, when  know that boasting is an honour,

shall promulgate,— fetch my life and being

From men of royal siege. And my demerits

May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune

As this that  have reach’d. For know, Iago,

But that  love the gentle Desdemona,

would not my unhoused free condition

Put into circumscription and confine

For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come yond?


Those are the raised father and his friends:

You were best go in.


Not ;  must be found.

My parts, my title, and my perfect soul

Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?


By Janus,  think no.



The servants of the duke and my lieutenant.

The goodness of the night upon you, friends!

What is the news?


The duke does greet you, general,

And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance

Even on the instant.


What is the matter, think you?


Something from Cyprus, as  may divine.

It is a business of some heat. The galleys

Have sent a dozen sequent messengers

This very night at one another’s heels;

And many of the consuls, rais’d and met,

Are at the duke’s already. You have been hotly call’d for,

When, being not at your lodging to be found,

The senate hath sent about three several quests

To search you out.


’Tis well  am found by you.

And go with you.



Ancient, what makes he here?


Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack:

If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.

He’s married.


To who?



Marry to—Come, captain, will you go?


Have with you.


Here comes another troop to seek for you.



It is Brabantio. General, be advis’d,

He comes to bad intent.


Holla, stand there!


Signior, it is the Moor.


Down with him, thief!



You, Roderigo! Come, sir,  am for you.


Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.

Good signior, you shall more command with years

Than with your weapons.


thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter?

Damn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,

For ’ll refer me to all things of sense,


Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,

So opposite to marriage, that she shunn’d

The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,

Would ever have, to incur a general mock,

Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom

Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.

Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense,

That thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms,

Abus’d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals

That weakens motion. ’ll have’t disputed on;

’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.

therefore apprehend and do attach thee

For an abuser of the world, a practise
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.—

Lay hold upon him, if he do resist,

Subdue him at his peril.


Hold your hands,

Both you of my inclining and the rest:

Were it my cue to fight,  should have known it

Without a prompter. Where will you that  go

To answer this your charge?


To prison, till fit time

Of law and course of direct session

Call thee to answer.


What if  do obey?

How may the duke be therewith satisfied,

Whose messengers are here about my side,

Upon some present business of the state,

To bring me to him?


’Tis true, most worthy signior,

The duke’s in council, and your noble self,

am sure is sent for.


How? The duke in council?

In this time of the night? Bring him away;

Mine’s not an idle cause. The duke himself,

Or any of my brothers of the state,

Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.

For if such actions may have passage free,

Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.


Venice.  council chamber.

The Duke and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending.


There is no composition in these news

That gives them credit.


Indeed, they are disproportion’d;

My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.


And mine a hundred and forty.


And mine two hundred:

But though they jump not on a just account,

(As in these cases, where the aim reports,

’Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm

But the main article  do approve

Now,—what’s the business?


The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,

So was  bid report here to the state

By Signior Angelo.


How say you by this change?


This cannot be

By no assay of reason. ’Tis a pageant

To keep us in false gaze. When we conside
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;

And let ourselves again but understand

That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,

So may he with more facile question bear it,

For that it stands not in such warlike brace,

But altogether lacks the abilities

That Rhodes is dress’d in. If we make thought of this,

We must not think the Turk is so unskilful

To leave that latest which concerns him first,

Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,

To wake and wage a danger profitless.


Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.


Here is more news.



The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,

Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,

Have there injointed them with an after fleet.


Ay, so  thought. How many, as you guess?


Of thirty sail, and now they do re-stem

Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance

Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,

Your trusty and most valiant servitor,

With his free duty recommends you thus,

And prays you to believe him.


’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?


He’s now in Florence.


Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.


Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.



Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you

Against the general enemy Ottoman.

did not see you; welcome, gentle signior,

We lack’d your counsel and your help tonight.


So did  yours. Good your grace, pardon me.

Neither my place, nor aught  heard of business

Hath rais’d me from my bed, nor doth the general care

Take hold on me; for my particular grief

Is of so flood-gate and o’erbearing nature

That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,

And it is still itself.


Why, what’s the matter?


My daughter! , my daughter!

and 

Dead?


Ay, to me.

She is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted

By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;

For nature so preposterously to err,

Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,

Sans witchcraft could not.


Whoe’er he be, that in this foul proceeding,

Hath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself,

And you of her, the bloody book of law

You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,

After your own sense, yea, though our proper son

Stood in your action.


Humbly  thank your grace.

Here is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems

Your special mandate for the state affairs

Hath hither brought.


We are very sorry for ’t.


What, in your own part, can you say to this?


Nothing, but this is so.


Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,

My very noble and approv’d good masters:

That  have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,

It is most true; true,  have married her.

The very head and front of my offending

Hath this extent, no more. Rude am  in my speech,

And little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace;

For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,

Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d

Their dearest action in the tented field,

And little of this great world can  speak,

More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,

And therefore little shall  grace my cause

In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,

will a round unvarnish’d tale delive
Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,

What conjuration, and what mighty magic,


won his daughter.


maiden never bold:

Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion

Blush’d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,

Of years, of country, credit, everything,

To fall in love with what she fear’d to look on!

It is judgement maim’d and most imperfect

That will confess perfection so could er
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven

To find out practices of cunning hell,

Why this should be.  therefore vouch again,

That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,

Or with some dram conjur’d to this effect,

He wrought upon her.


To vouch this is no proof;

Without more wider and more overt test

Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods

Of modern seeming do prefer against him.


But, Othello, speak:

Did you by indirect and forced courses

Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections?

Or came it by request, and such fair question

As soul to soul affordeth?


do beseech you,

Send for the lady to the Sagittary,

And let her speak of me before her father.

If you do find me foul in her report,

The trust, the office  do hold of you,

Not only take away, but let your sentence

Even fall upon my life.


Fetch Desdemona hither.


Ancient, conduct them, you best know the place.


And till she come, as truly as to heaven

do confess the vices of my blood,

So justly to your grave ears ’ll present

How  did thrive in this fair lady’s love,

And she in mine.


Say it, Othello.


Her father lov’d me, oft invited me,

Still question’d me the story of my life,

From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes,

That  have pass’d.

ran it through, even from my boyish days

To the very moment that he bade me tell it,

Wherein  spake of most disastrous chances,

Of moving accidents by flood and field;

Of hair-breadth scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach;

Of being taken by the insolent foe,

And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,

And portance in my traveler’s history,

Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,

Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,

It was my hint to speak,—such was the process;

And of the Cannibals that each other eat,

The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads

Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hea
Would Desdemona seriously incline.

But still the house affairs would draw her thence,

Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,

She’d come again, and with a greedy ea
Devour up my discourse; which  observing,

Took once a pliant hour, and found good means

To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart

That  would all my pilgrimage dilate,

Whereof by parcels she had something heard,

But not intentively.  did consent,

And often did beguile her of her tears,

When  did speak of some distressful stroke

That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,

She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.

She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange;

’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.

She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d

That heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,

And bade me, if  had a friend that lov’d her,

should but teach him how to tell my story,

And that would woo her. Upon this hint  spake:

She lov’d me for the dangers  had pass’d,

And  lov’d her that she did pity them.

This only is the witchcraft  have us’d.

Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.



think this tale would win my daughter too.

Good Brabantio,

Take up this mangled matter at the best.

Men do their broken weapons rather use

Than their bare hands.


pray you hear her speak.

If she confess that she was half the wooer,

Destruction on my head, if my bad blame

Light on the man!—Come hither, gentle mistress:

Do you perceive in all this noble company

Where most you owe obedience?


My noble father,

do perceive here a divided duty:

To you  am bound for life and education.

My life and education both do learn me

How to respect you. You are the lord of duty,

am hitherto your daughter: but here’s my husband.

And so much duty as my mother show’d

To you, preferring you before her father,

So much  challenge that  may profess

Due to the Moor my lord.


God be with you!  have done.

Please it your grace, on to the state affairs.

Come hither, Moor:

here do give thee that with all my heart

Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart

would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel,

am glad at soul  have no other child,

For thy escape would teach me tyranny,

To hang clogs on them.— have done, my lord.


Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,

Which as a grise or step may help these lovers

Into your favour.

When remedies are past, the griefs are ended

By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.

To mourn a mischief that is past and gone

Is the next way to draw new mischief on.

What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,

Patience her injury a mockery makes.

The robb’d that smiles steals something from the thief;

He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.


So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,

We lose it not so long as we can smile;

He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears

But the free comfort which from thence he hears;

But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow

That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.

These sentences to sugar or to gall,

Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:

But words are words;  never yet did hea
That the bruis’d heart was pierced through the ear.

humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.


The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the

fortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a

substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign

mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must

therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with

this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.


The tyrant custom, most grave senators,

Hath made the flinty and steel couch of wa
My thrice-driven bed of down:  do agnize

This present wars against the Ottomites.

Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state,

crave fit disposition for my wife,

Due reference of place and exhibition,

With such accommodation and besort

As levels with her breeding.


If you please,

Be’t at her father’s.


’ll not have it so.


Nor .


Nor .  would not there reside,

To put my father in impatient thoughts,

By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,

To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,

And let me find a charter in your voice

What would you, Desdemona?


That  did love the Moor to live with him,

My downright violence and storm of fortunes

May trumpet to the world: my heart’s subdued

Even to the very quality of my lord.

And to his honours and his valiant parts

Did  my soul and fortunes consecrate.

So that, dear lords, if  be left behind,

moth of peace, and he go to the war,

The rites for which  love him are bereft me,

And  a heavy interim shall support

By his dear absence. Let me go with him.


Let her have your voice.

Vouch with me, heaven,  therefore beg it not

To please the palate of my appetite,

Nor to comply with heat, the young affects

In me defunct, and proper satisfaction,

But to be free and bounteous to her mind.

And heaven defend your good souls that you think

will your serious and great business scant

For she is with me. No, when light-wing’d toys

Of feather’d Cupid seel with wanton dullness

My speculative and offic’d instruments,

That my disports corrupt and taint my business,

Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,

And all indign and base adversities

Make head against my estimation.


Be it as you shall privately determine,

Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,

And speed must answer it.


You must away tonight.


With all my heart.


At nine i’ the morning here we’ll meet again.

Othello, leave some officer behind,

And he shall our commission bring to you,

With such things else of quality and respect

As doth import you.


So please your grace, my ancient,

man he is of honesty and trust,

To his conveyance  assign my wife,

With what else needful your good grace shall think

To be sent after me.


Let it be so.

Good night to everyone.  And, noble signior,

If virtue no delighted beauty lack,

Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.


Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.


Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:

She has deceiv’d her father, and may thee.



My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,

My Desdemona must  leave to thee.

prithee, let thy wife attend on her,

And bring them after in the best advantage.—

Come, Desdemona,  have but an hou
Of love, of worldly matters, and direction,

To spend with thee. We must obey the time.



Iago—


What sayst thou, noble heart?


What will  do, thinkest thou?


Why, go to bed and sleep.


will incontinently drown myself.


If thou dost,  shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!


It is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a

prescription to die when death is our physician.


villainous!  have looked upon the world for four times seven years,

and since  could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury,  neve
found man that knew how to love himself. Ere  would say  would drown

myself for the love of a guinea-hen,  would change my humanity with a

baboon.


What should  do?  confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not

in my virtue to amend it.


Virtue! a fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies

are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will

plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it

with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it

sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and

corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of ou
lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the

blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous

conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal

stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof  take this, that you call love, to

be a sect, or scion.


It cannot be.


It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be

a man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies.  have professed me

thy friend, and  confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of

perdurable toughness;  could never better stead thee than now. Put

money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an

usurped beard;  say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that

Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put money in thy

purse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt

see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors

are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that

to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb

as the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with

his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change,

she must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn

thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money

thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian

and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the

tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money.  pox of

drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be

hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.


Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if  depend on the issue?


Thou art sure of me. Go, make money.  have told thee often, and 

retell thee again and again,  hate the Moor. My cause is hearted;

thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against

him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a

sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be

delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this

tomorrow. Adieu.

In double knavery. How, how? Let’s see.

For  have serv’d him, and the man commands

Come, let’s do so;

For every minute is expectancy

Of more arrivance.



Thanks you, the valiant of this warlike isle,

That so approve the Moor! , let the heavens

Give him defence against the elements,

For  have lost him on a dangerous sea.

Of very expert and approv’d allowance;

Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,

But, good lieutenant, is your general wiv’d?


Most fortunately: he hath achiev’d a maid

That paragons description and wild fame,

One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,

And in the essential vesture of creation

Does tire the ingener.


How now? Who has put in?


’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.


He has had most favourable and happy speed:

Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,

The gutter’d rocks, and congregated sands,

Traitors ensteep’d to clog the guiltless keel,

As having sense of beauty, do omit

Their mortal natures, letting go safely by

The divine Desdemona.


What is she?


She that  spake of, our great captain’s captain,

Left in the conduct of the bold Iago;

Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts

And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,

That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,

Make love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,

Give renew’d fire to our extincted spirits,

And bring all Cyprus comfort!


, behold,

The riches of the ship is come on shore!

Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.

Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,

Before, behind thee, and on every hand,

Enwheel thee round!

But that he’s well, and will be shortly here.

This likewise is a friend.


See for the news.


Good ancient, you are welcome.  Welcome, mistress.

Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,

That  extend my manners; ’tis my breeding

That gives me this bold show of courtesy.



Sir, would she give you so much of her lips

As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,

You would have enough.


Alas, she has no speech.


In faith, too much.

Marry, before your ladyship,  grant,

She puts her tongue a little in her heart,

And chides with thinking.


You have little cause to say so.


Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,

Bells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens,

Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,

Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.


, fie upon thee, slanderer!


Nay, it is true, or else  am a Turk.

You rise to play, and go to bed to work.


You shall not write my praise.


No, let me not.


What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?


gentle lady, do not put me to’t,

For  am nothing if not critical.


Come on, assay.—There’s one gone to the harbour?


Ay, madam.

Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze,

It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,

And thus she is deliver’d.

The one’s for use, the other useth it.


Well prais’d! How if she be black and witty?


If she be black, and thereto have a wit,

She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.


Worse and worse.


How if fair and foolish?


She never yet was foolish that was fair,

For even her folly help’d her to an heir.


These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i’ the alehouse. What

miserable praise hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish?


There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,

But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the

authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice

She that was ever fair and never proud,

Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,

Never lack’d gold and yet went never gay,

Fled from her wish, and yet said, “Now  may”;

She that, being anger’d, her revenge being nigh,

Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;

She that in wisdom never was so frail

To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail;

She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,

She was a wight, if ever such wight were—

though he be thy husband.—How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane

and liberal counsellor?


He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in

the scholar.


He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said, whisper. With as

little a web as this will  ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile

upon her, do.  will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true,

’tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of you

so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good;

well kissed, an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet again you

The Moor!  know his trumpet.


’Tis truly so.


Let’s meet him, and receive him.


Lo, where he comes!



my fair warrior!


My dear Othello!


It gives me wonder great as my content

To see you here before me.  my soul’s joy!

If after every tempest come such calms,

May the winds blow till they have waken’d death!

And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas

Olympus-high, and duck again as low

As hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,

’Twere now to be most happy, for  fea
My soul hath her content so absolute

That not another comfort like to this

Succeeds in unknown fate.


The heavens forbid

But that our loves and comforts should increase

Even as our days do grow!


Amen to that, sweet powers!

cannot speak enough of this content.

It stops me here; it is too much of joy:

And this, and this, the greatest discords be 

That e’er our hearts shall make!


, you are well tun’d now,

But ’ll set down the pegs that make this music,

As honest as  am.


Come, let us to the castle.—

News, friends, our wars are done, the Turks are drown’d.

How does my old acquaintance of this isle?

Honey, you shall be well desir’d in Cyprus;

have found great love amongst them.  my sweet,

prattle out of fashion, and  dote

In mine own comforts.— prithee, good Iago,

Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.

Bring thou the master to the citadel;

He is a good one, and his worthiness

Does challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona,

Once more well met at Cyprus.



Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be’st

valiant—as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in

their natures more than is native to them—list me. The lieutenant

tonight watches on the court of guard: first,  must tell thee this:

Desdemona is directly in love with him.


With him? Why, ’tis not possible.


Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what

violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling he
fantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy

discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall

she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act

of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a

fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and

beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these

required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused,

begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature

will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir,

this granted  who

stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a

knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere

form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt

and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none!  slipper and

subtle knave, a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can stamp and

counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself: a

devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all

those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. 

pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.


cannot believe that in her, she is full of most blessed condition.


Blest fig’s end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been

blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst

thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?


Yes, that  did. But that was but courtesy.


Lechery, by this hand. An index and obscure prologue to the history of

lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that thei
breaths embrac’d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these

mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main

exercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by

me.  have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight. For the command,

’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. ’ll not be far from you. Do

you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, o
tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which

the time shall more favourably minister.


Well.


Sir, he is rash, and very sudden in choler, and haply with his

truncheon may strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of

that will  cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall

come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So

shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means  shall

then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed,

without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.


will do this, if  can bring it to any opportunity.


warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:  must fetch his

necessaries ashore. Farewell.


Adieu.



That Cassio loves her,  do well believe it;

That she loves him, ’tis apt, and of great credit:

The Moor, howbeit that  endure him not,

Is of a constant, loving, noble nature;

And,  dare think, he’ll prove to Desdemona

most dear husband. Now,  do love her too,

Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure

stand accountant for as great a sin)

But partly led to diet my revenge,

For that  do suspect the lusty Moo
Hath leap’d into my seat. The thought whereof

Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,

And nothing can or shall content my soul

Till  am even’d with him, wife for wife,

Or, failing so, yet that  put the Moo
At least into a jealousy so strong

That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,

If this poor trash of Venice, whom  trash

For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,

’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,

Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb


Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me

For making him egregiously an ass

And practicing upon his peace and quiet

Even to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confus’d.

Knavery’s plain face is never seen till us’d.


street.



It is Othello’s pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that upon

certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the

Turkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph: some to dance, some

to make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addition leads

him. For besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his

nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are

open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of

five till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus

and our noble general Othello!


Hall in the Castle.



Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.

Let’s teach ourselves that honourable stop,

Not to outsport discretion.


Iago hath direction what to do.

But notwithstanding with my personal eye

Will  look to’t.


Iago is most honest.

Michael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest

Let me have speech with you.  Come, my dear love,

The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;

That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.—

Good night.




Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch.


Not this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’ clock. Our general

cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not

therefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and

she is sport for Jove.


She’s a most exquisite lady.


And, ’ll warrant her, full of game.


Indeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature.


What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.


An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.


And when she speaks, is it not an alarm to love?


She is indeed perfection.


Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,  have a stoup of

wine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain

have a measure to the health of black Othello.


Not tonight, good Iago.  have very poor and unhappy brains fo
drinking.  could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of

entertainment.


, they are our friends; but one cup: ’ll drink for you.


have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too,

and behold, what innovation it makes here:  am unfortunate in the

infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.


What, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants desire it.


Where are they?


Here at the door.  pray you, call them in.


’ll do’t; but it dislikes me.



If  can fasten but one cup upon him,

With that which he hath drunk tonight already,

He’ll be as full of quarrel and offence

As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,

Whom love hath turn’d almost the wrong side out,

To Desdemona hath tonight carous’d

Potations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch:

Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,

That hold their honours in a wary distance,

The very elements of this warlike isle,

Have  tonight fluster’d with flowing cups,

And they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards,

Am  to put our Cassio in some action

That may offend the isle. But here they come:

If consequence do but approve my dream,

My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.



’Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.


Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as  am a soldier.


Some wine, ho!


_And let me the cannikin clink, clink,

And let me the cannikin clink, clink:

soldier’s a man,

, man’s life’s but a span,

Why then let a soldier drink._

Some wine, boys!


’Fore God, an excellent song.


learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting:

your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander,—drink, ho!—are

nothing to your English.


Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?


Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not

to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next

pottle can be filled.


To the health of our general!


am for it, lieutenant; and ’ll do you justice.


sweet England!


_King Stephen was a worthy peer,

His breeches cost him but a crown;

He held them sixpence all too dear,

With that he call’d the tailor lown.

He was a wight of high renown,

And thou art but of low degree:

’Tis pride that pulls the country down,

Then take thine auld cloak about thee._

Some wine, ho!


’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than the other.


Will you hear ’t again?


No, for  hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things.

Well, God’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be

souls must not be saved.


It’s true, good lieutenant.


For mine own part, no offence to the general, nor any man of quality, 

hope to be saved.


And so do  too, lieutenant.


Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved

before the ancient. Let’s have no more of this; let’s to our affairs.

Forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not

think, gentlemen,  am drunk. This is my ancient, this is my right

hand, and this is my left.  am not drunk now.  can stand well enough,

and  speak well enough.


Excellent well.


Why, very well then. You must not think, then, that  am drunk.



To the platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch.


You see this fellow that is gone before,

He is a soldier fit to stand by Cæsa
And give direction: and do but see his vice,

’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,

The one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him.

On some odd time of his infirmity,

Will shake this island.


But is he often thus?


’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:

He’ll watch the horologe a double set

If drink rock not his cradle.


It were well

The general were put in mind of it.

Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature

Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,

And looks not on his evils: is not this true?



How now, Roderigo?

pray you, after the lieutenant; go.



And ’tis great pity that the noble Moo
Should hazard such a place as his own second

With one of an ingraft infirmity:

It were an honest action to say so

To the Moor.


Not , for this fair island.

do love Cassio well and would do much

To cure him of this evil. But, hark! What noise?




Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!


What’s the matter, lieutenant?


knave teach me my duty! ’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.


Beat me?


Dost thou prate, rogue?



Nay, good lieutenant;

pray you, sir, hold your hand.


Let me go, sir,

Or ’ll knock you o’er the mazard.


Come, come, you’re drunk.


Drunk?



Away,  say! Go out and cry a mutiny.


Nay, good lieutenant, God’s will, gentlemen.

Help, ho!—Lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—sir:—

Help, masters! Here’s a goodly watch indeed!


Who’s that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!

The town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold,

You will be sham’d forever.



What is the matter here?


Zounds,  bleed still,  am hurt to the death.


Hold, for your lives!


Hold, ho! lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—gentlemen,—

Have you forgot all  place of sense and duty?

Hold! The general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!


Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?

Are we turn’d Turks, and to ourselves do that

Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?

For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:

He that stirs next to carve for his own rage

Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.

Silence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle

From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?

Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,

Speak, who began this? On thy love,  charge thee.


do not know. Friends all but now, even now,

In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom

Devesting them for bed; and then, but now,

As if some planet had unwitted men,

Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,

In opposition bloody.  cannot speak

Any beginning to this peevish odds;

And would in action glorious  had lost

Those legs that brought me to a part of it!


How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?


pray you, pardon me;  cannot speak.


Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.

The gravity and stillness of your youth

The world hath noted, and your name is great

In mouths of wisest censure: what’s the matter,

That you unlace your reputation thus,

And spend your rich opinion for the name

Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.


Worthy Othello,  am hurt to danger.

Your officer, Iago, can inform you,

While  spare speech, which something now offends me,

Of all that  do know; nor know  aught

By me that’s said or done amiss this night,

Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,

And to defend ourselves it be a sin

When violence assails us.


Now, by heaven,

My blood begins my safer guides to rule,

And passion, having my best judgement collied,

Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if  stir,

Or do but lift this arm, the best of you

Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know

How this foul rout began, who set it on,

And he that is approv’d in this offence,

Though he had twinn’d with me, both at a birth,

Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,

Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,

To manage private and domestic quarrel,

In night, and on the court and guard of safety?

’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began’t?


If partially affin’d, or leagu’d in office,

Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,

Thou art no soldier.


Touch me not so near.

had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth

Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.

Yet  persuade myself, to speak the truth

Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:

Montano and myself being in speech,

There comes a fellow crying out for help,

And Cassio following him with determin’d sword,

To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman

Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.

Myself the crying fellow did pursue,

Lest by his clamou
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,

Outran my purpose: and  return’d the rathe
For that  heard the clink and fall of swords,

And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight

ne’er might say before. When  came back,

found them close together,

At blow and thrust, even as again they were

When you yourself did part them.

More of this matter cannot  report.

But men are men; the best sometimes forget;

Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,

As men in rage strike those that wish them best,

Yet surely Cassio,  believe, receiv’d

From him that fled some strange indignity,

Which patience could not pass.


know, Iago,

Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,

Making it light to Cassio. Cassio,  love thee,

But never more be officer of mine.


Look, if my gentle love be not rais’d up!

’ll make thee an example.


What’s the matter?


All’s well now, sweeting; come away to bed.

Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.

Lead him off.


Iago, look with care about the town,

And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.

Come, Desdemona: ’tis the soldiers’ life

To have their balmy slumbers wak’d with strife.



What, are you hurt, lieutenant?


Ay, past all surgery.


Marry, Heaven forbid!


Reputation, reputation, reputation! ,  have lost my reputation! 

have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My

reputation, Iago, my reputation!


As  am an honest man,  thought you had received some bodily wound;

there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle

and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without

deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute

yourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general

again: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy

than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to

affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he’s yours.


will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commande
with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and

speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with

one’s own shadow?  thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name

to be known by, let us call thee devil!


What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?


know not.


Is’t possible?


remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but

nothing wherefore.  God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths

to steal away their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel,

and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!


Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered?


It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath.

One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.


Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the

condition of this country stands,  could heartily wish this had not

befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.


will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me  am a drunkard!

Had  as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To

be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! 

strange! Every inordinate cup is unbless’d, and the ingredient is a

devil.


Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.

Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant,  think you think 

love you.


have well approved it, sir.— drunk!


You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. ’ll tell you what

you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general;  may say so in

this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the

contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess

yourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place

again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,

she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is

requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to

splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of

You advise me well.

virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me;  am desperate of my fortunes

if they check me here.


You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant,  must to the watch.


Good night, honest Iago.



And what’s he then, that says  play the villain?

When this advice is free  give and honest,

Probal to thinking, and indeed the course

To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy

The inclining Desdemona to subdue

In any honest suit. She’s fram’d as fruitful

As the free elements. And then for he
To win the Moor, were’t to renounce his baptism,

All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,

His soul is so enfetter’d to her love

That she may make, unmake, do what she list,

Even as her appetite shall play the god

With his weak function. How am  then, a villain

To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,

Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!

When devils will the blackest sins put on,

They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,

As  do now: for whiles this honest fool

Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,

And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,

’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,

That she repeals him for her body’s lust;

And by how much she strives to do him good,

She shall undo her credit with the Moor.

So will  turn her virtue into pitch,

And out of her own goodness make the net

That shall enmesh them all.


How now, Roderigo?


do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one

that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent,  have been tonight

exceedingly well cudgelled; and  think the issue will be,  shall have

so much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a

little more wit, return again to Venice.


How poor are they that have not patience!

What wound did ever heal but by degrees?

Thou know’st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,

And wit depends on dilatory time.

Does’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,

And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier’d Cassio;

Though other things grow fair against the sun,

Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.

Content thyself awhile. By the mass, ’tis morning;

Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.

Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.

Away,  say, thou shalt know more hereafter.

Nay, get thee gone.


Two things are to be done,

My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.

’ll set her on;

Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,

And bring him jump when he may Cassio find

Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.

Dull not device by coldness and delay.



. Cyprus. Before the Castle.



Masters, play here,  will content your pains,

Something that’s brief; and bid “Good morrow, general.”




Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i’

the nose thus?


How, sir, how?


Are these,  pray you, wind instruments?


Ay, marry, are they, sir.


, thereby hangs a tail.


Whereby hangs a tale, sir?


Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that  know. But, masters, here’s

money for you: and the general so likes your music, that he desires

you, for love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.


Well, sir, we will not.


If you have any music that may not be heard, to’t again. But, as they

say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.


We have none such, sir.


Then put up your pipes in your bag, for ’ll away. Go, vanish into air,

away!



Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?


No,  hear not your honest friend.  hear you.


Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There’s a poor piece of gold for thee:

if the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stirring, tell

her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech. Wilt

thou do this?


She is stirring, sir; if she will stir hither,  shall seem to notify

unto her.


Do, good my friend.



In happy time, Iago.


You have not been a-bed, then?


Why, no. The day had broke

Before we parted.  have made bold, Iago,

To send in to your wife. My suit to he
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona

Procure me some access.


’ll send her to you presently,

And ’ll devise a mean to draw the Moo
Out of the way, that your converse and business

May be more free.


humbly thank you for’t.


never knew

Florentine more kind and honest.



Good morrow, good lieutenant;  am sorry

For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.

The general and his wife are talking of it,

And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies

That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus

And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom

He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you

And needs no other suitor but his likings

To take the safest occasion by the front

To bring you in again.


Yet,  beseech you,

If you think fit, or that it may be done,

Give me advantage of some brief discourse

With Desdemona alone.


Pray you, come in.

will bestow you where you shall have time

To speak your bosom freely.

Cyprus.  Room in the Castle.



These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,

And by him do my duties to the senate.

That done,  will be walking on the works,

Repair there to me.


Well, my good lord, ’ll do’t.


This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see’t?


We’ll wait upon your lordship.


Cyprus. The Garden of the Castle.



Be thou assured, good Cassio,  will do

All my abilities in thy behalf.


Good madam, do.  warrant it grieves my husband

As if the cause were his.


, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,

But  will have my lord and you again

As friendly as you were.


Bounteous madam,

Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,

He’s never anything but your true servant.


know’t.  thank you. You do love my lord.

You have known him long; and be you well assur’d

He shall in strangeness stand no farther off

Than in a politic distance.


Ay, but, lady,

That policy may either last so long,

Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,

Or breed itself so out of circumstance,

That,  being absent, and my place supplied,

My general will forget my love and service.


Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here

give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,

If  do vow a friendship, ’ll perform it

To the last article. My lord shall never rest,

’ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;

His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;

’ll intermingle everything he does

With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,

For thy solicitor shall rather die

Than give thy cause away.



Madam, here comes my lord.


Madam, ’ll take my leave.


Why, stay, and hear me speak.


Madam, not now.  am very ill at ease,

Unfit for mine own purposes.


Well, do your discretion.



Ha,  like not that.


What dost thou say?


Nothing, my lord; or if— know not what.


Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?


Cassio, my lord? No, sure,  cannot think it,

That he would steal away so guilty-like,

Seeing you coming.


do believe ’twas he.


How now, my lord?

have been talking with a suitor here,

man that languishes in your displeasure.


Who is’t you mean?


Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,

If  have any grace or power to move you,

His present reconciliation take;

For if he be not one that truly loves you,

That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,

have no judgement in an honest face.

prithee call him back.


Went he hence now?


Ay, sooth; so humbled

That he hath left part of his grief with me

To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.


Not now, sweet Desdemon, some other time.


But shall’t be shortly?


The sooner, sweet, for you.


Shall’t be tonight at supper?


No, not tonight.


Tomorrow dinner then?


shall not dine at home;

meet the captains at the citadel.


Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,

On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn.

prithee name the time, but let it not

Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;

And yet his trespass, in our common reason,

(Save that, they say, the wars must make examples

Out of their best) is not almost a fault

To incur a private check. When shall he come?

Tell me, Othello:  wonder in my soul,

What you would ask me, that  should deny,

Or stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,

That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,

When  have spoke of you dispraisingly,

Hath ta’en your part, to have so much to do

To bring him in! Trust me,  could do much.


Prithee no more. Let him come when he will;

will deny thee nothing.


Why, this is not a boon;

’Tis as  should entreat you wear your gloves,

Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,

Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit

To your own person: nay, when  have a suit

Wherein  mean to touch your love indeed,

It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,

And fearful to be granted.


will deny thee nothing.

Whereon,  do beseech thee, grant me this,

To leave me but a little to myself.


Shall  deny you? No, farewell, my lord.


Farewell, my Desdemona. ’ll come to thee straight.


Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you.

Whate’er you be,  am obedient.



Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,

But  do love thee! And when  love thee not,

Chaos is come again.


My noble lord,—


What dost thou say, Iago?


Did Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady,

Know of your love?


He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?


But for a satisfaction of my thought.

No further harm.


Why of thy thought, Iago?


did not think he had been acquainted with her.


yes, and went between us very oft.


Indeed?


Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discern’st thou aught in that?

Is he not honest?


Honest, my lord?


Honest? ay, honest.


My lord, for aught  know.


What dost thou think?


Think, my lord?


Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,

As if there were some monster in his thought

Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.

heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,

When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?

And when  told thee he was of my counsel

In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed?”

And didst contract and purse thy brow together,

As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain

Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,

Show me thy thought.


My lord, you know  love you.


think thou dost;

And for  know thou’rt full of love and honesty

And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,

Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:

For such things in a false disloyal knave

Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,

They’re close dilations, working from the heart,

That passion cannot rule.


For Michael Cassio,

dare be sworn  think that he is honest.


think so too.


Men should be what they seem;

Or those that be not, would they might seem none!


Certain, men should be what they seem.


Why then,  think Cassio’s an honest man.


Nay, yet there’s more in this:

prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,

As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts

The worst of words.


Good my lord, pardon me.

Though  am bound to every act of duty,

am not bound to that all slaves are free to.

Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false:

As where’s that palace whereinto foul things

Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure

But some uncleanly apprehensions

Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit

With meditations lawful?


Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,

If thou but think’st him wrong’d and mak’st his ea
stranger to thy thoughts.


do beseech you,

Though  perchance am vicious in my guess,

As,  confess, it is my nature’s plague

To spy into abuses, and of my jealousy

Shapes faults that are not,—that your wisdom

From one that so imperfectly conceits,

Would take no notice; nor build yourself a trouble

Out of his scattering and unsure observance.

It were not for your quiet nor your good,

Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,

To let you know my thoughts.


What dost thou mean?


Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,

Is the immediate jewel of their souls.

Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing;

’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.

But he that filches from me my good name

Robs me of that which not enriches him

And makes me poor indeed.


By heaven, ’ll know thy thoughts.


You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,

Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.


Ha?


, beware, my lord, of jealousy;

It is the green-ey’d monster which doth mock

The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss

Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;

But , what damned minutes tells he o’e
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!


misery!


Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;

But riches fineless is as poor as winte
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.

Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend

From jealousy!


Why, why is this?

Think’st thou ’d make a life of jealousy,

To follow still the changes of the moon

With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt

Is once to be resolv’d: exchange me for a goat

When  shall turn the business of my soul

To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,

Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous,

To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,

Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;

Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:

Nor from mine own weak merits will  draw

The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,

For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,

’ll see before  doubt; when  doubt, prove;

And on the proof, there is no more but this:

Away at once with love or jealousy!


am glad of it, for now  shall have reason

To show the love and duty that  bear you

With franker spirit: therefore, as  am bound,

Receive it from me.  speak not yet of proof.

Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;

Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.

Out of self-bounty, be abus’d. Look to’t.

In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks

They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience

Is not to leave undone, but keep unknown.


Dost thou say so?


She did deceive her father, marrying you;

And when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,

She loved them most.


And so she did.


Why, go to then.

She that so young could give out such a seeming,

To seal her father’s eyes up close as oak,

He thought ’twas witchcraft. But  am much to blame.

For too much loving you.

My speech should fall into such vile success

My lord,  see you’re mov’d.


No, not much mov’d.

do not think but Desdemona’s honest.


Long live she so! And long live you to think so!


And yet, how nature erring from itself—


Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,

Not to affect many proposed matches,

Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,

Whereto we see in all things nature tends;

Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,

Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.

But pardon me:  do not in position

Distinctly speak of her, though  may fea
Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,

May fall to match you with her country forms,

And happily repent.


Farewell, farewell:

If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;

Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.


My lord,  take my leave.


Why did  marry? This honest creature doubtless

Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.


My lord,  would  might entreat your honou
To scan this thing no further. Leave it to time:

Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,

For sure he fills it up with great ability,

Yet if you please to hold him off awhile,

You shall by that perceive him and his means.

Note if your lady strain his entertainment

With any strong or vehement importunity,

Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,

Let me be thought too busy in my fears


And hold her free,  do beseech your honour.


Fear not my government.

For nothing canst thou to damnation add

And being troubled with a raging tooth,

There are a kind of men so loose of soul,

That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.

One of this kind is Cassio:

In sleep  heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona,

Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;”

And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,

Cry “ sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,

As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,

That grew upon my lips, then laid his leg

Over my thigh, and sigh’d and kiss’d, and then

Cried “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!”

One is too poor, too weak for my revenge!

Now do  see ’tis true. Look here, Iago;

All my fond love thus do  blow to heaven.

’Tis gone.

Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!

Yield up,  love, thy crown and hearted throne

To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,

For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!


Yet be content.


, blood, Iago, blood!


Patience,  say. Your mind perhaps may change.


Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,

Whose icy current and compulsive course

Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on

To the Propontic and the Hellespont;

Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace

Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,

Till that a capable and wide revenge

Swallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,

In the due reverence of a sacred vow 

here engage my words.


Do not rise yet. 

Witness, you ever-burning lights above,

You elements that clip us round about,

Witness that here Iago doth give up

The execution of his wit, hands, heart,

To wrong’d Othello’s service! Let him command,

And to obey shall be in me remorse,

What bloody business ever.

Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,

And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.

Within these three days let me hear thee say

That Cassio’s not alive.


My friend is dead. ’Tis done at your request.

But let her live.


Damn her, lewd minx! , damn her, damn her!

Come, go with me apart,  will withdraw

To furnish me with some swift means of death

For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

Cyprus. Before the Castle.



Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?


dare not say he lies anywhere.


Why, man?


He’s a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing.


Go to. Where lodges he?


To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where  lie.


Can anything be made of this?


know not where he lodges; and for me to devise a lodging, and say he

lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.


Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him  have moved my lord on his

To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore  will

attempt the doing it.



Where should  lose that handkerchief, Emilia?


know not, madam.


Believe me,  had rather have lost my purse

Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moo
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness

As jealous creatures are, it were enough

To put him to ill thinking.


Is he not jealous?


Who, he?  think the sun where he was born

Drew all such humours from him.


Look, where he comes.

Well, my good lady.  , hardness to dissemble!

How do you, Desdemona?


Well, my good lord.


Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.


It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.


This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.

Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires

sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,

Much castigation, exercise devout;

For here’s a young and sweating devil here

That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,

frank one.


You may indeed say so,

For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.

What promise, chuck?

have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.

Lend me thy handkerchief.


Here, my lord.


That which  gave you.


have it not about me.


Not?


No, faith, my lord.


That is a fault. That handkerchief

Did an Egyptian to my mother give.

She was a charmer, and could almost read

The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,

’Twould make her amiable and subdue my fathe
Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,

Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye

Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt

After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me,

And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,

To give it her.  did so; and take heed on’t,

Make it a darling like your precious eye.

To lose’t or give’t away were such perdition

As nothing else could match.


Is’t possible?


’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.

sibyl, that had number’d in the world

The sun to course two hundred compasses,

In her prophetic fury sew’d the work;

The worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk,

And it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful

Conserv’d of maiden’s hearts.


Indeed? Is’t true?


Most veritable, therefore look to ’t well.


Then would to God that  had never seen ’t!


Ha? wherefore?


Why do you speak so startingly and rash?


Is’t lost? is’t gone? speak, is it out of the way?


Heaven bless us!


Say you?


It is not lost, but what and if it were?


How?


say it is not lost.


Fetch’t, let me see ’t.


Why, so  can, sir, but  will not now.

This is a trick to put me from my suit.

Pray you, let Cassio be receiv’d again.


Fetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives.


Come, come.

You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.


The handkerchief!


pray, talk me of Cassio.


The handkerchief!


man that all his time

Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,

Shar’d dangers with you,—


The handkerchief!


In sooth, you are to blame.


Away!



Is not this man jealous?


ne’er saw this before.

Sure there’s some wonder in this handkerchief,

am most unhappy in the loss of it.


’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:

They are all but stomachs and we all but food;

They eat us hungerly, and when they are full,

They belch us.


Look you, Cassio and my husband.


There is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,

And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.


How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?


Madam, my former suit:  do beseech you

That by your virtuous means  may again

Exist, and be a member of his love,

Whom , with all the office of my heart,

Entirely honour.  would not be delay’d.

If my offence be of such mortal kind

That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,

Nor purpos’d merit in futurity,

Can ransom me into his love again,

But to know so must be my benefit;

So shall  clothe me in a forc’d content,

And shut myself up in some other course

To fortune’s alms.


Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,

My advocation is not now in tune;

My lord is not my lord; nor should  know him

Were he in favour as in humour alter’d.

So help me every spirit sanctified,

As  have spoken for you all my best,

And stood within the blank of his displeasure

For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.

What  can do  will; and more  will

Than for myself  dare. Let that suffice you.


Is my lord angry?


He went hence but now,

And certainly in strange unquietness.


Can he be angry?  have seen the cannon,

When it hath blown his ranks into the ai
And, like the devil, from his very arm

Puff’d his own brother, and can he be angry?

Something of moment then.  will go meet him.

There’s matter in’t indeed if he be angry.


prithee do so.


Something sure of state,

Either from Venice, or some unhatch’d practice

Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,

Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases

Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,

Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.

For let our finger ache, and it indues

Our other healthful members even to that sense

Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,

Nor of them look for such observancy

As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,

was 

Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;

But now  find  had suborn’d the witness,

And he’s indicted falsely.


Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,

And no conception nor no jealous toy

Concerning you.


Alas the day,  never gave him cause!


But jealous souls will not be answer’d so;

They are not ever jealous for the cause,

But jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monste
Begot upon itself, born on itself.


Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!


Lady, amen.


will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:

If  do find him fit, ’ll move your suit,

And seek to effect it to my uttermost.


humbly thank your ladyship.




Save you, friend Cassio!


What make you from home?

How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?

’ faith, sweet love,  was coming to your house.


And  was going to your lodging, Cassio.

What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights?

Eight score eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours,

More tedious than the dial eight score times?

weary reckoning!


Pardon me, Bianca.

have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d,

But  shall in a more continuate time

Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,


Take me this work out.


Cassio, whence came this?

This is some token from a newer friend.

To the felt absence now  feel a cause.

Is’t come to this? Well, well.


Go to, woman!

Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,

From whence you have them. You are jealous now

That this is from some mistress, some remembrance.

No, in good troth, Bianca.


Why, whose is it?


know not neither.  found it in my chamber.

like the work well. Ere it be demanded,

As like enough it will, ’d have it copied.

Take it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.


Leave you, wherefore?


do attend here on the general,

And think it no addition, nor my wish,

To have him see me woman’d.


Why,  pray you?


Not that  love you not.


But that you do not love me.

pray you bring me on the way a little,

And say if  shall see you soon at night.


’Tis but a little way that  can bring you,

For  attend here. But ’ll see you soon.


’Tis very good;  must be circumstanc’d.



. Cyprus. Before the Castle.



Will you think so?


Think so, Iago?


What,

To kiss in private?


An unauthoriz’d kiss.


Or to be naked with her friend in bed

An hour or more, not meaning any harm?


Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?

It is hypocrisy against the devil:

They that mean virtuously and yet do so,

The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.


So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.

But if  give my wife a handkerchief—


What then?


Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,

She may,  think, bestow’t on any man.


She is protectress of her honour too.

May she give that?


Her honour is an essence that’s not seen;

They have it very oft that have it not:

But for the handkerchief—


By heaven,  would most gladly have forgot it.

Thou said’st (, it comes o’er my memory,

As doth the raven o’er the infected house,

Boding to all) he had my handkerchief.


Ay, what of that?


That’s not so good now.


What

If  had said  had seen him do you wrong?

Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,

Who having, by their own importunate suit,

Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,

Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose

But they must blab.)


Hath he said anything?


He hath, my lord, but be you well assur’d,

No more than he’ll unswear.


What hath he said?


Faith, that he did— know not what he did.


What? What?


Lie.


With her?


With her, on her, what you will.


Lie with her! lie on her!—We say lie on her when they belie her.—Lie

with her! that’s fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To

confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to

confess.  tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such

shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake

me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is’t

possible?—Confess?—handkerchief?— devil!—



Work on,

My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,

And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,

All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!

My lord,  say! Othello!


How now, Cassio!


What’s the matter?


My lord is fallen into an epilepsy.

This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.


Rub him about the temples.


No, forbear;

The lethargy must have his quiet course.

If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by

Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs:

Do you withdraw yourself a little while,

He will recover straight. When he is gone,

would on great occasion speak with you.


How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?


Dost thou mock me?


mock you? No, by heaven.

Would you would bear your fortune like a man!


horned man’s a monster and a beast.


There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,

And many a civil monster.


Did he confess it?


Good sir, be a man.

Think every bearded fellow that’s but yok’d

May draw with you. There’s millions now alive

That nightly lie in those unproper beds

Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.

, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,

To lip a wanton in a secure couch,

And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,

And knowing what  am,  know what she shall be.


, thou art wise, ’tis certain.


Stand you awhile apart,

Confine yourself but in a patient list.

Whilst you were here o’erwhelmed with your grief,


Cassio came hither.  shifted him away,

And laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy,

Bade him anon return, and here speak with me,

The which he promis’d. Do but encave yourself,

And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,

That dwell in every region of his face;

For  will make him tell the tale anew,

Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when

He hath, and is again to cope your wife:

say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,

Or  shall say you are all in all in spleen,

And nothing of a man.


Dost thou hear, Iago?

will be found most cunning in my patience;

But,—dost thou hear?—most bloody.


That’s not amiss.

But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?


Now will  question Cassio of Bianca,

housewife that by selling her desires

Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature

That dotes on Cassio, (as ’tis the strumpet’s plague

To beguile many and be beguil’d by one.)

He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain

From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.


As he shall smile Othello shall go mad,

And his unbookish jealousy must construe

Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviou
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?


The worser that you give me the addition

Whose want even kills me.


Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on’t.

Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,

How quickly should you speed!


Alas, poor caitiff!


Look how he laughs already!


never knew a woman love man so.


Alas, poor rogue!  think, i’ faith, she loves me.


Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.


Do you hear, Cassio?


Now he importunes him

To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.


She gives it out that you shall marry her.

Do you intend it?


Ha, ha, ha!


Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?


marry her? What?  customer?  prithee, bear some charity to my wit,

do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!


So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.


Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.


Prithee say true.


am a very villain else.


Have you scored me? Well.


This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is persuaded  will marry her,

out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.


Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.


She was here even now. She haunts me in every place.  was the othe
day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes

the bauble, and falls thus about my neck.


Crying, “ dear Cassio!” as it were: his gesture imports it.


So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha,

ha!


Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. ,  see that nose of

yours, but not that dog  shall throw it to.


Well,  must leave her company.


Before me! look where she comes.



’Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum’d one.

What do you mean by this haunting of me?


Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same

handkerchief you gave me even now?  was a fine fool to take it.  must

take out the work?  likely piece of work, that you should find it in

your chamber and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token,

and  must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse.

Wheresoever you had it, ’ll take out no work on’t.


How now, my sweet Bianca? How now, how now?


By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!


If you’ll come to supper tonight, you may. If you will not, come when

you are next prepared for.



After her, after her.


Faith,  must; she’ll rail in the street else.


Will you sup there?


Faith,  intend so.


Well,  may chance to see you, for  would very fain speak with you.


Prithee come, will you?


Go to; say no more.



How shall  murder him, Iago?


Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?


Iago!


And did you see the handkerchief?


Was that mine?


Yours, by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman you
wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.


would have him nine years a-killing.  fine woman, a fair woman, a

sweet woman!


Nay, you must forget that.


Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for she shall not

live. No, my heart is turned to stone;  strike it, and it hurts my

hand. , the world hath not a sweeter creature. She might lie by an

emperor’s side, and command him tasks.


Nay, that’s not your way.


Hang her,  do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle, an

admirable musician! , she will sing the savageness out of a bear! Of

so high and plenteous wit and invention!


She’s the worse for all this.


, a thousand, a thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!


Ay, too gentle.


Nay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!  Iago, the pity of

it, Iago!


If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if

it touch not you, it comes near nobody.


will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!


, ’tis foul in her.


With mine officer!


That’s fouler.


Get me some poison, Iago; this night. ’ll not expostulate with her,

lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.


Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath

contaminated.


Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very good.


And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by

midnight.


Excellent good.  What trumpet is that same?



Something from Venice, sure. ’Tis Lodovico

Come from the duke. See, your wife is with him.


Save you, worthy general!


With all my heart, sir.


The duke and senators of Venice greet you.



kiss the instrument of their pleasures.



And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?


am very glad to see you, signior.

Welcome to Cyprus.


thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?


Lives, sir.


Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord

An unkind breach, but you shall make all well.


Are you sure of that?


My lord?


“This fail you not to do, as you will—”


He did not call; he’s busy in the paper.

Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?


most unhappy one.  would do much

To atone them, for the love  bear to Cassio.


Fire and brimstone!


My lord?


Are you wise?


What, is he angry?


May be the letter mov’d him;

For, as  think, they do command him home,

Deputing Cassio in his government.


Trust me,  am glad on’t.


Indeed!


My lord?


am glad to see you mad.


Why, sweet Othello?


Devil!



have not deserv’d this.


My lord, this would not be believ’d in Venice,

Though  should swear  saw’t: ’tis very much.

Make her amends. She weeps.


devil, devil!

If that the earth could teem with woman’s tears,

Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.

Out of my sight!


will not stay to offend you.



Truly, an obedient lady.

do beseech your lordship, call her back.


Mistress!


My lord?


What would you with her, sir?


Who, , my lord?


Ay, you did wish that  would make her turn.

Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,

And turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep;

And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient,

Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.

Concerning this, sir,— well-painted passion!

am commanded home.—Get you away;

’ll send for you anon.—Sir,  obey the mandate,

And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!


Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,

do entreat that we may sup together.

You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!



Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate

Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature

Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue

The shot of accident nor dart of chance

Could neither graze nor pierce?


He is much chang’d.


Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?


He’s that he is.  may not breathe my censure

What he might be. If what he might he is not,

would to heaven he were!


What, strike his wife?


Faith, that was not so well; yet would  knew

That stroke would prove the worst!


Is it his use?

Or did the letters work upon his blood,

And new-create this fault?


Alas, alas!

It is not honesty in me to speak

What  have seen and known. You shall observe him,

And his own courses will denote him so

That  may save my speech: do but go after,

And mark how he continues.


am sorry that  am deceiv’d in him.


Cyprus.  Room in the Castle.



You have seen nothing, then?


Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.


Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.


But then  saw no harm, and then  heard

Each syllable that breath made up between them.


What, did they never whisper?


Never, my lord.


Nor send you out o’ the way?


Never.


To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?


Never, my lord.


That’s strange.


durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,

Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,

Remove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom.

If any wretch have put this in your head,

Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse,

For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,

There’s no man happy. The purest of their wives

Is foul as slander.


Bid her come hither. Go.


She says enough. Yet she’s a simple bawd

That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,

closet lock and key of villainous secrets.

And yet she’ll kneel and pray.  have seen her do ’t.



My lord, what is your will?


Pray, chuck, come hither.


What is your pleasure?


Let me see your eyes.

Look in my face.


What horrible fancy’s this?


Some of your function, mistress,

Leave procreants alone, and shut the door.

Cough, or cry hem, if anybody come.

Your mystery, your mystery. Nay, dispatch.



Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?

understand a fury in your words,

But not the words.


Why, what art thou?


Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.


Come, swear it, damn thyself,

Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves

Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn’d.

Swear thou art honest.


Heaven doth truly know it.


Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.


To whom, my lord? With whom? How am  false?


Desdemona, away! away! away!


Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?

Am  the motive of these tears, my lord?

If haply you my father do suspect

An instrument of this your calling back,

Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,

Why,  have lost him too.


Had it pleas’d heaven

To try me with affliction, had they rain’d

All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,

Steep’d me in poverty to the very lips,

Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,

should have found in some place of my soul

drop of patience. But, alas, to make me

fixed figure for the time of scorn

To point his slow unmoving finger at.

Yet could  bear that too, well, very well:

But there, where  have garner’d up my heart,

Where either  must live or bear no life,

The fountain from the which my current runs,

Or else dries up, to be discarded thence,

Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads

To knot and gender in!—turn thy complexion there,

Patience, thou young and rose-lipp’d cherubin,

Ay, there, look grim as hell!


hope my noble lord esteems me honest.


, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,

That quicken even with blowing.  thou weed,

Who art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet,

That the sense aches at thee,

Would thou hadst ne’er been born!


Alas, what ignorant sin have  committed?


Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,

Made to write “whore” upon? What committed?

Committed!  thou public commoner!

should make very forges of my cheeks,

That would to cinders burn up modesty,

Did  but speak thy deeds. What committed!

Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;

The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,

Is hush’d within the hollow mine of earth,

And will not hear it. What committed!

Impudent strumpet!


By heaven, you do me wrong.


Are not you a strumpet?


No, as  am a Christian:

If to preserve this vessel for my lord

From any other foul unlawful touch

Be not to be a strumpet,  am none.


What, not a whore?


No, as  shall be sav’d.


Is’t possible?


, heaven forgive us!


cry you mercy then.

took you for that cunning whore of Venice

That married with Othello.—You, mistress,


That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,

And keeps the gate of hell. You, you, ay, you!

We have done our course; there’s money for your pains.

pray you turn the key, and keep our counsel.



Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?

How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?


Faith, half asleep.


Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?


With who?


Why, with my lord, madam.


Who is thy lord?


He that is yours, sweet lady.


have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia,

cannot weep, nor answer have  none

But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight

Lay on my bed my wedding sheets, remember,

And call thy husband hither.


Here’s a change indeed!



’Tis meet  should be us’d so, very meet.

How have  been behav’d, that he might stick

The small’st opinion on my least misuse?



What is your pleasure, madam? How is’t with you?


cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes

Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.

He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,

am a child to chiding.


What’s the matter, lady?


Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhor’d her,

Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,

As true hearts cannot bear.


Am  that name, Iago?


What name, fair lady?


Such as she says my lord did say  was.


He call’d her whore: a beggar in his drink

Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.


Why did he so?


do not know.  am sure  am none such.


Do not weep, do not weep: alas the day!


Hath she forsook so many noble matches,

Her father, and her country, and her friends,

To be call’d whore? would it not make one weep?


It is my wretched fortune.


Beshrew him for’t!

How comes this trick upon him?


Nay, heaven doth know.


will be hang’d, if some eternal villain,

Some busy and insinuating rogue,

Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,

Have not devis’d this slander. ’ll be hang’d else.


Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.


If any such there be, heaven pardon him!


halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!

Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?

What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?

The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,

Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.

heaven, that such companions thou’dst unfold,

And put in every honest hand a whip

To lash the rascals naked through the world

Even from the east to the west!


Speak within door.


, fie upon them! Some such squire he was

That turn’d your wit the seamy side without,

And made you to suspect me with the Moor.


You are a fool. Go to.


Alas, Iago,

What shall  do to win my lord again?

Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,

know not how  lost him. Here  kneel.

If e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,

Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,

Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,

Delighted them in any other form,

Or that  do not yet, and ever did,

And ever will, (though he do shake me off

To beggarly divorcement) love him dearly,

Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;

And his unkindness may defeat my life,

But never taint my love.  cannot say “whore,”

It does abhor me now  speak the word;

To do the act that might the addition earn

Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me.


pray you, be content. ’Tis but his humour.

The business of the state does him offence,

And he does chide with you.


If ’twere no other,—


’Tis but so,  warrant.


Hark, how these instruments summon to supper.

The messengers of Venice stay the meat.

Go in, and weep not. All things shall be well.



How now, Roderigo?


do not find that thou dealest justly with me.


What in the contrary?


Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it

seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with

the least advantage of hope.  will indeed no longer endure it. Nor am

yet persuaded to put up in peace what already  have foolishly

suffered.


Will you hear me, Roderigo?


Faith,  have heard too much, for your words and performances are no

kin together.


You charge me most unjustly.


With naught but truth.  have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels

you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted

a votarist: you have told me she hath received them, and returned me

expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but 

find none.


Well, go to, very well.


Very well, go to,  cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well. Nay, 

say ’tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.


Very well.


tell you ’tis not very well.  will make myself known to Desdemona.

If she will return me my jewels,  will give over my suit and repent my

unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself  will seek satisfaction

of you.


You have said now.


Ay, and said nothing but what  protest intendment of doing.


Why, now  see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do

build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand,

Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet 

protest,  have dealt most directly in thy affair.


It hath not appeared.


grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without

wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed,

which  have greater reason to believe now than ever,— mean purpose,

courage, and valour,—this night show it. If thou the next night

following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery

and devise engines for my life.


Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?


Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in

Othello’s place.


Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.


, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fai
Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein

none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.


How do you mean “removing” of him?


Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his

brains.


And that you would have me to do?


Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with

a harlotry, and thither will  go to him. He knows not yet of his

honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which  will

fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at you
pleasure:  will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall

between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me.  will

show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself

bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows

to waste. About it.

And you shall be satisfied.

, pardon me; ’twill do me good to walk.


Madam, good night.  humbly thank your ladyship.


Your honour is most welcome.


Will you walk, sir?—

My lord?


Get you to bed on th’ instant,  will be return’d forthwith. Dismiss

your attendant there. Look ’t be done.


will, my lord.



How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.


He says he will return incontinent,

He hath commanded me to go to bed,

And bade me to dismiss you.


Dismiss me?


It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,

Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.

We must not now displease him.

So would not . My love doth so approve him,

That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,—

Prithee, unpin me,—have grace and favour in them.

All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!

If  do die before thee, prithee, shroud me

In one of those same sheets.


Come, come, you talk.


My mother had a maid call’d Barbary,

She was in love, and he she lov’d prov’d mad

And did forsake her. She had a song of “willow”,

And she died singing it. That song tonight

Will not go from my mind.  have much to do

But to go hang my head all at one side

And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee dispatch.


Shall  go fetch your night-gown?


No, unpin me here.

He speaks well.

_The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,

Sing all a green willow.

Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,

Sing willow, willow, willow.

The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur’d her moans,

Sing willow, willow, willow;

Her salt tears fell from her, and soften’d the stones;—_

_Sing willow, willow, willow._

_Sing all a green willow must be my garland.

It’s the wind.



_I call’d my love false love; but what said he then?

Dost thou in conscience think,—tell me, Emilia,—

That there be women do abuse their husbands

In such gross kind?


There be some such, no question.


Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?


Why, would not you?


No, by this heavenly light!


Nor  neither by this heavenly light,

might do’t as well i’ the dark.


Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?


The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price

For a small vice.


In troth,  think thou wouldst not.


In troth,  think  should, and undo’t when  had done. Marry,  would

not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor fo
gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the

whole world—why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a

monarch?  should venture purgatory for ’t.


Beshrew me, if  would do such a wrong for the whole world.


Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world; and having the world fo
your labour, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make

it right.


do not think there is any such woman.


Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they

played for.

But  do think it is their husbands’ faults

If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,

And pour our treasures into foreign laps;

Or else break out in peevish jealousies,

Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,

Or scant our former having in despite.

Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace,

Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know

Their wives have sense like them: they see, and smell

And have their palates both for sweet and sour,

As husbands have. What is it that they do

When they change us for others? Is it sport?

think it is. And doth affection breed it?

think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs?

It is so too. And have not we affections,

Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?

Then let them use us well: else let them know,

The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.


Good night, good night. Heaven me such usage send,

Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

Here, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he come.

Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.

Quick, quick, fear nothing; ’ll be at thy elbow.

And fix most firm thy resolution.

And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,

Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,

Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,

He calls me to a restitution large

Of gold and jewels that  bobb’d from him,

As gifts to Desdemona.

It must not be. If Cassio do remain,

He hath a daily beauty in his life

That makes me ugly. And besides, the Moo
May unfold me to him; there stand  in much peril.

[_Iago rushes from his post, cuts Cassio behind in the leg, and

exit._]

The voice of Cassio. Iago keeps his word.


, villain that  am!


It is even so.


, help, ho! light! a surgeon!


’Tis he.  brave Iago, honest and just,

That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!

Thou teachest me,—minion, your dear lies dead,

And your unbless’d fate hies. Strumpet,  come!

Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;

Thy bed, lust-stain’d, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.




What, ho! No watch? No passage? murder, murder!


’Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.


, help!


Hark!


wretched villain!


Two or three groan. It is a heavy night.

These may be counterfeits. Let’s think’t unsafe

To come in to the cry without more help.


Nobody come? Then shall  bleed to death.



Hark!


Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.


Who’s there? Whose noise is this that cries on murder?


We do not know.


Did not you hear a cry?


Here, here! for heaven’s sake, help me!


What’s the matter?


This is Othello’s ancient, as  take it.


The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.


What are you here that cry so grievously?


Iago? ,  am spoil’d, undone by villains!

Give me some help.

And cannot make away.

What are you there?

Come in and give some help.


, help me here!


That’s one of them.


murderous slave!  villain!



damn’d Iago!  inhuman dog!


Kill men i’ the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?

How silent is this town! Ho! murder! murder!

What may you be? Are you of good or evil?


As you shall prove us, praise us.


Signior Lodovico?


He, sir.


cry you mercy. Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.


Cassio!


How is’t, brother?


My leg is cut in two.


Marry, heaven forbid!

Light, gentlemen, ’ll bind it with my shirt.



What is the matter, ho? Who is’t that cried?


Who is’t that cried?


my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio!  Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!


notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect

Who they should be that have thus mangled you?


No.


am sorry to find you thus;  have been to seek you.


Lend me a garter. So.—, for a chair,

To bear him easily hence!


Alas, he faints!  Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!


Gentlemen all,  do suspect this trash

To be a party in this injury.

Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;

Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?

Alas, my friend and my dear countryman

Roderigo? No. Yes, sure;  heaven! Roderigo.


What, of Venice?


Even he, sir. Did you know him?


Know him? Ay.


Signior Gratiano?  cry you gentle pardon.

These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,

That so neglected you.


am glad to see you.


How do you, Cassio? , a chair, a chair!


Roderigo!


He, he, ’tis he.


, that’s well said; the chair.

Some good man bear him carefully from hence,

’ll fetch the general’s surgeon.  For you, mistress,

Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,

Was my dear friend. What malice was between you?


None in the world. Nor do  know the man.


What, look you pale?—, bear him out o’ the air.


Stay you, good gentlemen.—Look you pale, mistress?

Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?

Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.

Behold her well.  pray you, look upon her.

Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak

Though tongues were out of use.



’Las, what’s the matter? What’s the matter, husband?


Cassio hath here been set on in the dark

By Roderigo, and fellows that are ’scap’d.

He’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.


Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!


This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,

Go know of Cassio where he supp’d tonight.

What, do you shake at that?


He supp’d at my house, but  therefore shake not.


, did he so?  charge you go with me.


Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!


am no strumpet, but of life as honest

As you that thus abuse me.


As ? Foh! fie upon thee!


Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dress’d.

Come, mistress, you must tell’s another tale.

Emilia, run you to the citadel,

And tell my lord and lady what hath happ’d.

Will you go on afore?  This is the night

That either makes me or fordoes me quite.


Cyprus.  Bedchamber in the castle.

Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.



It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,

Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!

It is the cause. Yet ’ll not shed her blood,

Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,

And smooth as monumental alabaster.

Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.

Put out the light, and then put out the light:

If  quench thee, thou flaming minister,

can again thy former light restore,

Should  repent me. But once put out thy light,

Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,

know not where is that Promethean heat

That can thy light relume. When  have pluck’d thy rose,

cannot give it vital growth again,

It must needs wither. ’ll smell it on the tree.


, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade

Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.

Be thus when thou art dead, and  will kill thee,

And love thee after. One more, and this the last.

So sweet was ne’er so fatal.  must weep,

But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly,

It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.


Who’s there? Othello?


Ay, Desdemona.


Will you come to bed, my lord?


Have you pray’d tonight, Desdemona?


Ay, my lord.


If you bethink yourself of any crime

Unreconcil’d as yet to heaven and grace,

Solicit for it straight.


Alack, my lord, what may you mean by that?


Well, do it, and be brief,  will walk by.

would not kill thy unprepared spirit,

No, heaven forfend!  would not kill thy soul.


Talk you of killing?


Ay,  do.


Then heaven have mercy on me!


Amen, with all my heart!


If you say so,  hope you will not kill me.


Hum!


And yet  fear you, for you are fatal then

When your eyes roll so: why  should fear  know not,

Since guiltiness  know not, but yet  feel  fear.


Think on thy sins.


They are loves  bear to you.


Ay, and for that thou diest.


That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.

Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?

Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.

These are portents; but yet  hope,  hope,

They do not point on me.


Peace, and be still!


will so. What’s the matter?


That handkerchief which  so loved and gave thee,

Thou gav’st to Cassio.


No, by my life and soul!

Send for the man and ask him.


Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury,

Thou’rt on thy death-bed.


Ay, but not yet to die.


Yes, presently:

Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin.

For to deny each article with oath

Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception

That  do groan withal. Thou art to die.


Then, Lord have mercy on me!


say, amen.


And have you mercy too!  never did

Offend you in my life,	 never lov’d Cassio

But with such general warranty of heaven

As  might love.  never gave him token.


By heaven,  saw my handkerchief in ’s hand.

And mak’st me call what  intend to do

murder, which  thought a sacrifice.

He found it then.

never gave it him. Send for him hither.

Let him confess a truth.


He hath confess’d.


What, my lord?


That he hath us’d thee.


How? Unlawfully?


Ay.


He will not say so.


No, his mouth is stopp’d.

Honest Iago hath ta’en order for ’t.


, my fear interprets! What, is he dead?


Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge

Had stomach for them all.


Alas, he is betray’d, and  undone!


Out, strumpet! Weep’st thou for him to my face?


, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!


Down, strumpet!


Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight!


Nay, if you strive,—


But half an hour!


Being done, there is no pause.


But while  say one prayer!


It is too late.



My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!


What noise is this? Not dead? Not yet quite dead?

that am cruel am yet merciful,

would not have thee linger in thy pain.

So, so.


What, ho! my lord, my lord!


Who’s there?


, good my lord,  would speak a word with you!


Yes. ’Tis Emilia, by and by. She’s dead.

’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death;

The noise was high.—Ha! no more moving?

Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were’t good?

think she stirs again; no. What’s best to do?

If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.

My wife! my wife! what wife?  have no wife.

, insupportable!  heavy hour!

Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse

Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe

Should yawn at alteration.


do beseech you

That  may speak with you, , good my lord!


had forgot thee: , come in, Emilia.

Soft, by and by; let me the curtains draw.

Where art thou?



What’s the matter with thee now?


, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done!


What, now?


But now, my lord.


It is the very error of the moon,

She comes more nearer earth than she was wont

And makes men mad.


Cassio, my lord, hath kill’d a young Venetian

Call’d Roderigo.


Roderigo kill’d?

And Cassio kill’d?


No, Cassio is not kill’d.


Not Cassio kill’d! Then murder’s out of tune,

And sweet revenge grows harsh.


, falsely, falsely murder’d!


Alas, what cry is that?


That? What?


Out, and alas! That was my lady’s voice.

Help! help, ho! help!  lady, speak again,

Sweet Desdemona!  sweet mistress, speak!


guiltless death  die.


, who hath done this deed?


Nobody;  myself. Farewell.

Commend me to my kind lord. , farewell!



Why, how should she be murder’d?


Alas, who knows?


You heard her say herself, it was not .


She said so.  must needs report the truth.


She’s like a liar, gone to burning hell.

’Twas  that kill’d her.


, the more angel she,

And you the blacker devil!


She turn’d to folly, and she was a whore.


Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.


She was false as water.


Thou art rash as fire, to say

That she was false: , she was heavenly true!


Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.

,  were damn’d beneath all depth in hell,

But that  did proceed upon just grounds

To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.


My husband?


Thy husband.


That she was false to wedlock?


Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,

If heaven would make me such another world

Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,

’d not have sold her for it.


My husband?


Ay, ’twas he that told me first.

An honest man he is, and hates the slime

That sticks on filthy deeds.


My husband?


What needs this iterance, woman?  say thy husband.


mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!

My husband say that she was false?


He, woman;

say thy husband: dost understand the word?

My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.


If he say so, may his pernicious soul

Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart.

She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.


Ha!


Do thy worst:

This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven

Than thou wast worthy her.


Peace, you were best.


Thou hast not half that power to do me harm

As  have to be hurt.  gull!  dolt!

As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed

’ll make thee known,

Though  lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!

The Moor hath kill’d my mistress! Murder, murder!



What is the matter? How now, general?


, are you come, Iago? You have done well,

That men must lay their murders on your neck.


What is the matter?


Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man.

He says thou told’st him that his wife was false.

know thou didst not, thou’rt not such a villain.

Speak, for my heart is full.


told him what  thought, and told no more

Than what he found himself was apt and true.


But did you ever tell him she was false?


did.


You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;

Upon my soul, a lie; a wicked lie.

She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?


With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.


will not charm my tongue;  am bound to speak.

My mistress here lies murder’d in her bed.


heavens forfend!


And your reports have set the murder on.


Nay, stare not, masters, it is true indeed.


’Tis a strange truth.


monstrous act!


Villany, villany, villany!

think upon’t,  think  smell’t;  villany!

thought so then. ’ll kill myself for grief.

villany, villany!


What, are you mad?  charge you, get you home.


Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.

’Tis proper  obey him, but not now.

Perchance, Iago,  will ne’er go home.


! ! !



Nay, lay thee down and roar;

For thou hast kill’d the sweetest innocent

That e’er did lift up eye.


, she was foul!

scarce did know you, uncle, there lies your niece,

Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp’d.

know this act shows horrible and grim.


Poor Desdemona!  am glad thy father’s dead.

Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief

Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,

This sight would make him do a desperate turn,

Yea, curse his better angel from his side,

And fall to reprobance.


’Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows

That she with Cassio hath the act of shame

thousand times committed; Cassio confess’d it,

And she did gratify his amorous works

With that recognizance and pledge of love

Which  first gave her;  saw it in his hand.

It was a handkerchief, an antique token

My father gave my mother.


heaven!  heavenly powers!


Come, hold your peace.


’Twill out, ’twill out.  peace?

No,  will speak as liberal as the north.

Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,

All, all, cry shame against me, yet ’ll speak.


Be wise, and get you home.

Fie!

Your sword upon a woman?


thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st of

found by fortune and did give my husband;

For often with a solemn earnestness,

More than indeed belong’d to such a trifle,

He begg’d of me to steal it.


Villanous whore!


She give it Cassio! no, alas,  found it,

And  did give’t my husband.


Filth, thou liest!


By heaven,  do not,  do not, gentlemen.

murderous coxcomb! What should such a fool

Do with so good a wife?


Are there not stones in heaven

But what serve for thunder? Precious villain!



The woman falls. Sure, he hath kill’d his wife.


Ay, ay. , lay me by my mistress’ side.


He’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.


’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,

Which  have here recover’d from the Moor.

Come, guard the door without, let him not pass,

But kill him rather. ’ll after that same villain,

For ’tis a damned slave.

But every puny whipster gets my sword.

But why should honour outlive honesty?

Let it go all.


What did thy song bode, lady?

Hark, canst thou hear me?  will play the swan,

And die in music.

_Willow, willow, willow._

Moor, she was chaste. She lov’d thee, cruel Moor,

So come my soul to bliss, as  speak true;

So speaking as  think,  die,  die.

It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook’s temper.

, here it is. Uncle,  must come forth.


If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;

Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.


Look in upon me then, and speak with me,

Or, naked as  am,  will assault thee.



What is the matter?


Behold,  have a weapon.

Upon a soldier’s thigh:  have seen the day

That with this little arm and this good sword

have made my way through more impediments

Than twenty times your stop. But,  vain boast!

Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.

Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon’d.

Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt,

And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.

Do you go back dismay’d? ’Tis a lost fear.

Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,

And he retires. Where should Othello go?

Now, how dost thou look now?  ill-starr’d wench,

Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,

This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,

And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!

Even like thy chastity.

cursed, cursed slave! Whip me, ye devils,

From the possession of this heavenly sight!

Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur,

Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!

Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! dead! Oh, oh!

Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?


That’s he that was Othello. Here  am.


Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.

If that thou be’st a devil,  cannot kill thee.



Wrench his sword from him.

For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.


thou Othello, that wert once so good,

Fall’n in the practice of a damned slave,

What shall be said to thee?


Why, anything;

An honourable murderer, if you will.

For naught did  in hate, but all in honour.


This wretch hath part confess’d his villany.

Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?


Ay.


Dear general,  never gave you cause.

Will you,  pray, demand that demi-devil

Why he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body?


Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.

From this time forth  never will speak word.


What, not to pray?


Torments will ope your lips.


Well, thou dost best.


Sir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,

Which, as  think, you know not. Here is a lette
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,

And here another. The one of them imports

The death of Cassio, to be undertook

By Roderigo.

Most heathenish and most gross!


Now here’s another discontented paper,

Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,

Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,

But that, belike, Iago in the interim

Came in and satisfied him.

How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief

That was my wife’s?

And he himself confess’d but even now,

That there he dropp’d it for a special purpose

Which wrought to his desire.


fool! fool! fool!


There is besides in Roderigo’s letter,

How he upbraids Iago, that he made him

Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came

That  was cast. And even but now he spake,

After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,

Iago set him on.


You must forsake this room, and go with us.

Your power and your command is taken off,

And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,

If there be any cunning cruelty

That can torment him much and hold him long,

It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,

Till that the nature of your fault be known

To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.


Soft you; a word or two before you go.

No more of that.  pray you, in your letters,

When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,

Speak of me as  am. Nothing extenuate,

Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak

Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;

Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,

Perplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,

Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away

Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu’d eyes,

Albeit unused to the melting mood,

Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees

Their medicinal gum. Set you down this.

And say besides, that in Aleppo once,

Where a malignant and a turban’d Turk

Beat a Venetian and traduc’d the state,

took by the throat the circumcised dog,

And smote him, thus.

All that’s spoke is marr’d.

Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

For he was great of heart.

Look on the tragic loading of this bed.

This is thy work. The object poisons sight,

Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,

And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,

For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,

Remains the censure of this hellish villain.

The time, the place, the torture, , enforce it!

Myself will straight aboard, and to the state

This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
