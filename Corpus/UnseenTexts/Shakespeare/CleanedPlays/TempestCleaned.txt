 

. On a ship at sea; a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning

heard.



Boatswain!


Here, master: what cheer?


Good! Speak to the mariners: fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves

aground: bestir, bestir.




Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the

topsail. Tend to th’ master’s whistle. Blow till thou burst thy wind,

if room enough.



Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master?

Play the men.


pray now, keep below.


Where is the master, boson?


Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do

assist the storm.


Nay, good, be patient.


When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king?

To cabin! silence! Trouble us not.


Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.


None that  more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can

command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present,

we will not hand a rope more. Use your authority: if you cannot, give

thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin

for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out

of our way,  say.



have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning

mark upon him. His complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good

Fate, to his hanging! Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for ou
own doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hang’d, our case is

miserable.


Re-enter Boatswain.


Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try wi’ th’

office.


Yet again! What do you here? Shall we give o’er, and drown? Have you a

mind to sink?


pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!


Work you, then.


Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid

to be drowned than thou art.


’ll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a

nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched wench.


Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses: off to sea again: lay he
off.



All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!



What, must our mouths be cold?


The King and Prince at prayers! Let’s assist them,

For our case is as theirs.

We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.

This wide-chapp’d rascal—would thou might’st lie drowning

The washing of ten tides!


He’ll be hang’d yet,

Though every drop of water swear against it,

And gape at wid’st to glut him.

_A confused noise within: _“Mercy on us!”—

“We split, we split!”—“Farewell, my wife and children!”—

“Farewell, brother!”—“We split, we split, we split!”


Let’s all sink wi’ th’ King.



Let’s take leave of him.



Now would  give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren

ground. Long heath, brown furze, anything. The wills above be done! but

would fain die a dry death.


The Island. Before the cell of Prospero.



If by your art, my dearest father, you have

Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.

The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,

But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,

Dashes the fire out. !  have suffered

With those that  saw suffer!  brave vessel,

Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,

Dash’d all to pieces. , the cry did knock

Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.

Had  been any god of power,  would

Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere

It should the good ship so have swallow’d and

The fraughting souls within her.


Be collected:

No more amazement: tell your piteous heart

There’s no harm done.


, woe the day!


No harm.

have done nothing but in care of thee,

Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who

Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing

Of whence  am, nor that  am more bette
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,

And thy no greater father.


More to know

Did never meddle with my thoughts.


’Tis time

should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,

And pluck my magic garment from me.—So:


Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.

The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch’d

The very virtue of compassion in thee,

So safely ordered that there is no soul—

No, not so much perdition as an hai
Betid to any creature in the vessel

Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;

For thou must now know farther.


You have often

Begun to tell me what  am, but stopp’d,

And left me to a bootless inquisition,

Concluding “Stay; not yet.”


The hour’s now come,

The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;

Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remembe
time before we came unto this cell?

do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not

Out three years old.


Certainly, sir,  can.


By what? By any other house, or person?

Of anything the image, tell me, that

Hath kept with thy remembrance.


’Tis far off,

And rather like a dream than an assurance

That my remembrance warrants. Had  not

Four or five women once that tended me?


Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it

That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else

In the dark backward and abysm of time?

If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here,

How thou cam’st here, thou mayst.


But that  do not.


Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,

Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and

prince of power.


Sir, are not you my father?


Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and

She said thou wast my daughter. And thy fathe
Was Duke of Milan, and his only hei
And princess, no worse issued.


, the heavens!

What foul play had we that we came from thence?

Or blessed was’t we did?


Both, both, my girl.

By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heav’d thence;

But blessedly holp hither.


, my heart bleeds

To think o’ th’ teen that  have turn’d you to,

Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.


My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio—

pray thee, mark me, that a brother should

Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself

Of all the world  lov’d, and to him put

The manage of my state; as at that time

Through all the signories it was the first,

And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed

In dignity, and for the liberal arts,

Without a parallel: those being all my study,

The government  cast upon my brother,

And to my state grew stranger, being transported

And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—

Dost thou attend me?


Sir, most heedfully.


Being once perfected how to grant suits,

How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who

To trash for over-topping, new created

The creatures that were mine,  say, or chang’d ’em,

Or else new form’d ’em: having both the key

Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state

To what tune pleas’d his ear: that now he was

The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,

And suck’d my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.


, good sir!  do.


pray thee, mark me.

, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated

To closeness and the bettering of my mind

With that which, but by being so retir’d,

’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brothe
Awak’d an evil nature; and my trust,

Like a good parent, did beget of him

falsehood in its contrary as great

As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,

confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,

Not only with what my revenue yielded,

But what my power might else exact, like one

Who having into truth, by telling of it,

Made such a sinner of his memory,

To credit his own lie, he did believe

He was indeed the Duke; out o’ the substitution,

And executing th’ outward face of royalty,

With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—

Dost thou hear?


Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.


To have no screen between this part he play’d

And him he play’d it for, he needs will be

Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library

Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties

He thinks me now incapable; confederates,

So dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples

To give him annual tribute, do him homage,

Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend

The dukedom, yet unbow’d—alas, poor Milan!—

To most ignoble stooping.


the heavens!


Mark his condition, and the event; then tell me

If this might be a brother.


should sin

To think but nobly of my grandmother:

Good wombs have borne bad sons.


Now the condition.

This King of Naples, being an enemy

To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;

Which was, that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises

Of homage and  know not how much tribute,

Should presently extirpate me and mine

Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,

With all the honours on my brother: whereon,

treacherous army levied, one midnight

Fated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open

The gates of Milan; and, i’ th’ dead of darkness,

The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence

Me and thy crying self.


Alack, for pity!

, not rememb’ring how  cried out then,

Will cry it o’er again: it is a hint

That wrings mine eyes to ’t.


Hear a little further,

And then ’ll bring thee to the present business

Which now’s upon us; without the which this story

Were most impertinent.


Wherefore did they not

That hour destroy us?


Well demanded, wench:

My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,

So dear the love my people bore me, nor set

mark so bloody on the business; but

With colours fairer painted their foul ends.

In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,

Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared

rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d,

Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats

Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,

To cry to th’ sea, that roar’d to us; to sigh

To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,

Did us but loving wrong.


Alack, what trouble

Was  then to you!


, a cherubin

Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,

Infused with a fortitude from heaven,

When  have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,

Under my burden groan’d: which rais’d in me

An undergoing stomach, to bear up

Against what should ensue.


How came we ashore?


By Providence divine.

Some food we had and some fresh water that

noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,

Out of his charity, who being then appointed

Master of this design, did give us, with

Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,

Which since have steaded much: so, of his gentleness,

Knowing  lov’d my books, he furnish’d me

From mine own library with volumes that

prize above my dukedom.


Would  might

But ever see that man!


Now  arise.

Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.

Here in this island we arriv’d; and here

Have , thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit

Than other princes can, that have more time

For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.


Heavens thank you for ’t! And now,  pray you, sir,

For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason

For raising this sea-storm?


Know thus far forth.

By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,

Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies

Brought to this shore; and by my prescience

find my zenith doth depend upon

most auspicious star, whose influence

If now  court not but omit, my fortunes

Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions;

Thou art inclin’d to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,

And give it way.  know thou canst not choose.


Come away, servant, come!  am ready now.

Approach, my Ariel. Come!



All hail, great master! grave sir, hail!  come

To answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,

To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride

On the curl’d clouds, to thy strong bidding task

Ariel and all his quality.


Hast thou, spirit,

Perform’d to point the tempest that  bade thee?


To every article.

boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak,

Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,

flam’d amazement; sometime ’d divide,

And burn in many places; on the topmast,

The yards, and bowsprit, would  flame distinctly,

Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors

’ th’ dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary

And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks

Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune

Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,

Yea, his dread trident shake.


My brave spirit!

Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil

Would not infect his reason?


Not a soul

But felt a fever of the mad, and play’d

Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners

Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,

Then all afire with me: the King’s son, Ferdinand,

With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair—

Was the first man that leapt; cried “Hell is empty,

And all the devils are here.”


Why, that’s my spirit!

But was not this nigh shore?


Close by, my master.


But are they, Ariel, safe?


Not a hair perish’d;

On their sustaining garments not a blemish,

But fresher than before: and, as thou bad’st me,

In troops  have dispers’d them ’bout the isle.

The King’s son have  landed by himself,

Whom  left cooling of the air with sighs

In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,

His arms in this sad knot.


Of the King’s ship

The mariners, say how thou hast dispos’d,

And all the rest o’ th’ fleet?


Safely in harbou
Is the King’s ship; in the deep nook, where once

Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew

From the still-vex’d Bermoothes; there she’s hid:

The mariners all under hatches stowed;

Who, with a charm join’d to their suff’red labour,

have left asleep: and for the rest o’ th’ fleet,

Which  dispers’d, they all have met again,

And are upon the Mediterranean flote

Bound sadly home for Naples,

Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wrack’d,

And his great person perish.


Ariel, thy charge

Exactly is perform’d; but there’s more work.

What is the time o’ th’ day?


Past the mid season.


At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now

Must by us both be spent most preciously.


Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,

Let me remember thee what thou hast promis’d,

Which is not yet perform’d me.


How now! moody?

What is’t thou canst demand?


My liberty.


Before the time be out? No more!


prithee,

Remember  have done thee worthy service;

Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv’d

Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise

To bate me a full year.


Dost thou forget

From what a torment  did free thee?


No.


Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze

Of the salt deep,

To run upon the sharp wind of the north,

To do me business in the veins o’ th’ earth

When it is bak’d with frost.


do not, sir.


Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot

The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy

Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?


No, sir.


Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak; tell me.


Sir, in Argier.


, was she so?  must

Once in a month recount what thou hast been,

Which thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,

For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible

To enter human hearing, from Argier,

Thou know’st, was banish’d: for one thing she did

They would not take her life. Is not this true?


Ay, sir.


This blue-ey’d hag was hither brought with child,

And here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave,

As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant;

And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate

To act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,

Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,

By help of her more potent ministers,

And in her most unmitigable rage,

Into a cloven pine; within which rift

Imprison’d, thou didst painfully remain

dozen years; within which space she died,

And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans

As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island—

Save for the son that she did litter here,

freckl’d whelp, hag-born—not honour’d with

human shape.


Yes, Caliban her son.


Dull thing,  say so; he, that Caliban,

Whom now  keep in service. Thou best know’st

What torment  did find thee in; thy groans

Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts

Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment

To lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax

Could not again undo; it was mine art,

When  arriv’d and heard thee, that made gape

The pine, and let thee out.


thank thee, master.


If thou more murmur’st,  will rend an oak

And peg thee in his knotty entrails till

Thou hast howl’d away twelve winters.


Pardon, master:

will be correspondent to command,

And do my spriting gently.


Do so; and after two days

will discharge thee.


That’s my noble master!

What shall  do? Say what? What shall  do?


Go make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea. Be subject

To no sight but thine and mine; invisible

To every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,

And hither come in ’t. Go, hence with diligence!


Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;

Awake!


The strangeness of your story put

Heaviness in me.


Shake it off. Come on;

We’ll visit Caliban my slave, who neve
Yields us kind answer.


’Tis a villain, sir,

do not love to look on.


But as ’tis,

We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,

Fetch in our wood; and serves in offices

That profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!

Thou earth, thou! Speak.


There’s wood enough within.


Come forth,  say; there’s other business for thee.

Come, thou tortoise! when?

Re-enter Ariel like a water-nymph.

Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,

Hark in thine ear.


My lord, it shall be done.



Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself

Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!



As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d

With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen

Drop on you both!  south-west blow on ye,

And blister you all o’er!


For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,

Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins

Shall forth at vast of night that they may work

All exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinch’d

As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging

Than bees that made them.


must eat my dinner.

This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother,

Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,

Thou strok’st me and made much of me; wouldst give me

Water with berries in ’t; and teach me how

To name the bigger light, and how the less,

That burn by day and night: and then  lov’d thee,

And show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,

The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile.

Curs’d be  that did so! All the charms

Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!

For  am all the subjects that you have,

Which first was mine own King; and here you sty me

In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me

The rest o’ th’ island.


Thou most lying slave,

Whom stripes may move, not kindness!  have us’d thee,

Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodg’d thee

In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate

The honour of my child.


Oh ho! Oh ho! Would ’t had been done!

Thou didst prevent me;  had peopled else

This isle with Calibans.


Abhorred slave,

Which any print of goodness wilt not take,

Being capable of all ill!  pitied thee,

Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hou
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,

Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like

thing most brutish,  endow’d thy purposes

With words that made them known. But thy vile race,

Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures

Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou

Deservedly confin’d into this rock,

Who hadst deserv’d more than a prison.


You taught me language, and my profit on ’t

Is,  know how to curse. The red plague rid you,

For learning me your language!


Hag-seed, hence!

Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou ’rt best,

To answer other business. Shrug’st thou, malice?

If thou neglect’st, or dost unwillingly

What  command, ’ll rack thee with old cramps,

Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,

That beasts shall tremble at thy din.


No, pray thee.

It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,

And make a vassal of him.


So, slave, hence!


Re-enter Ariel, playing and singing; Ferdinand following.

’ 

_Come unto these yellow sands,

And then take hands:

Curtsied when you have, and kiss’d

The wild waves whist.

Foot it featly here and there,

And sweet sprites bea
The burden. Hark, hark!_

Burden dispersedly. _Bow-wow.

The watch dogs bark._

_Bow-wow.

Hark, hark!  hea
The strain of strutting chanticlee
Cry cock-a-diddle-dow._


Where should this music be? i’ th’ air or th’ earth?

It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon

Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,

Weeping again the King my father’s wrack,

This music crept by me upon the waters,

Allaying both their fury and my passion

With its sweet air: thence  have follow’d it,

Or it hath drawn me rather,—but ’tis gone.

No, it begins again.



_Full fathom five thy father lies.

Of his bones are coral made.

Those are pearls that were his eyes.

Nothing of him that doth fade

But doth suffer a sea-change

Into something rich and strange.

Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:_

Burden: _Ding-dong.

Hark! now  hear them: ding-dong, bell._


The ditty does remember my drown’d father.

This is no mortal business, nor no sound

That the earth owes:— hear it now above me.


The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,

And say what thou seest yond.


What is’t? a spirit?

Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,

It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.


No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses

As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest

Was in the wrack; and, but he’s something stain’d

With grief,—that’s beauty’s canker,—thou mightst call him

goodly person: he hath lost his fellows

And strays about to find ’em.

As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! ’ll free thee

Within two days for this.


Most sure, the goddess

On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe, my praye
May know if you remain upon this island;

And that you will some good instruction give

How  may bear me here: my prime request,

Which  do last pronounce, is,  you wonder!

If you be maid or no?


No wonder, sir;

But certainly a maid.

Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan,

And his brave son being twain.

Who mak’st a show, but dar’st not strike, thy conscience

Is so possess’d with guilt: come from thy ward,

For  can here disarm thee with this stick

And make thy weapon drop.


Beseech you, father!


Hence! Hang not on my garments.


Sir, have pity;

An advocate for an impostor? hush!

Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,

Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!

To th’ most of men this is a Caliban,

And they to him are angels.

To see a goodlier man.


Come on; obey:

Thy nerves are in their infancy again,

And have no vigour in them.


So they are:

The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats,

To whom  am subdued, are but light to me,

Behold this maid: all corners else o’ th’ earth

Let liberty make use of; space enough

Have  in such a prison.


It works.  Come on.

Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!  Follow me.

Hark what thou else shalt do me.


Be of comfort;

My father’s of a better nature, sir,

Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted

Which now came from him.


Thou shalt be as free

As mountain winds; but then exactly do

All points of my command.

Come, follow. Speak not for him.

Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,

So have we all, of joy; for our escape

Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe

Is common; every day, some sailor’s wife,

The masters of some merchant and the merchant,

Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,

Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh

Our sorrow with our comfort.


Prithee, peace.

So. You’re paid.

He could not miss ’t.


It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.


Temperance was a delicate wench.


Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.


The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.


As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.


Or, as ’twere perfum’d by a fen.


Here is everything advantageous to life.

No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.


But the rarity of it is,—which is indeed almost beyond credit,—


As many vouch’d rarities are.


That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold

notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than

stained with salt water.


If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?


Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.


Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in

Afric, at the marriage of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King

of Tunis.


’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.


Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their Queen.


Not since widow Dido’s time.


Widow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow in? Widow Dido!


What if he had said, widower Aeneas too?

Good Lord, how you take it!


Widow Dido said you? You make me study of that; she was of Carthage,

not of Tunis.


This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.


Carthage?


assure you, Carthage.


His word is more than the miraculous harp.


He hath rais’d the wall, and houses too.


What impossible matter will he make easy next?


think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his

son for an apple.


And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.


Ay.


Why, in good time.


Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh

as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now

Queen.


And the rarest that e’er came there.


Bate,  beseech you, widow Dido.


! widow Dido; ay, widow Dido.


Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day  wore it?  mean, in

a sort.


That sort was well fish’d for.


When  wore it at your daughter’s marriage?


You cram these words into mine ears against

The stomach of my sense. Would  had neve
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,

My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,

Who is so far from Italy removed,

ne’er again shall see her.  thou mine hei
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish

Hath made his meal on thee?


Sir, he may live:

saw him beat the surges under him,

And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,

Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted

The surge most swoln that met him. His bold head

’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared

Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke

To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,

As stooping to relieve him.  not doubt

He came alive to land.


No, no, he’s gone.


Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,

That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,

But rather lose her to an African;

Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,

Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.


Prithee, peace.


You were kneel’d to, and importun’d otherwise

By all of us; and the fair soul herself

Weigh’d between loathness and obedience at

Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,

fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have

More widows in them of this business’ making,

Than we bring men to comfort them.

The fault’s your own.


So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.


My lord Sebastian,

The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness

And time to speak it in. You rub the sore,

When you should bring the plaster.


Very well.


And most chirurgeonly.


It is foul weather in us all, good sir,

When you are cloudy.


Foul weather?


Very foul.


Had  plantation of this isle, my lord,—


He’d sow ’t with nettle-seed.


Or docks, or mallows.


And were the King on’t, what would  do?


’Scape being drunk for want of wine.


’ th’ commonwealth  would by contraries

Execute all things; for no kind of traffic

Would  admit; no name of magistrate;

Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,

And use of service, none; contract, succession,

Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;

No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;

No occupation; all men idle, all;

And women too, but innocent and pure;

No sovereignty,—


Yet he would be King on’t.


The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.


All things in common nature should produce

Without sweat or endeavour; treason, felony,

Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,

Would  not have; but nature should bring forth,

Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,

To feed my innocent people.


No marrying ’mong his subjects?


None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.

Save his Majesty!


Long live Gonzalo!


And,—do you mark me, sir?


Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.


do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion to

these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they

always use to laugh at nothing.


’Twas you we laughed at.


Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you. So you may

continue, and laugh at nothing still.


What a blow was there given!


An it had not fallen flat-long.


You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You would lift the moon out of he
sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.



We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.


Nay, good my lord, be not angry.


No,  warrant you;  will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will

you laugh me asleep, for  am very heavy?


Go sleep, and hear us.



What, all so soon asleep!  wish mine eyes

Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts:  find

They are inclin’d to do so.


Please you, sir,

Do not omit the heavy offer of it:

It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,

It is a comforter.


We two, my lord,

Will guard your person while you take your rest,

And watch your safety.


Thank you. Wondrous heavy!



What a strange drowsiness possesses them!


It is the quality o’ th’ climate.


Why

Doth it not then our eyelids sink?  find not

Myself dispos’d to sleep.


Nor . My spirits are nimble.

They fell together all, as by consent;

They dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,

Worthy Sebastian? , what might?—No more.

And yet methinks  see it in thy face,

What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee; and

My strong imagination sees a crown

Dropping upon thy head.


What, art thou waking?


Do you not hear me speak?


do; and surely

It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st

Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?

This is a strange repose, to be asleep

With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,

And yet so fast asleep.


Noble Sebastian,

Thou let’st thy fortune sleep—die rather; wink’st

Whiles thou art waking.


Thou dost snore distinctly:

There’s meaning in thy snores.

Must be so too, if heed me; which to do

Do so: to ebb,

If you but knew how you the purpose cherish

Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,

You more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,

Most often, do so near the bottom run

By their own fear or sloth.


Prithee, say on:

The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim

matter from thee, and a birth, indeed

Which throes thee much to yield.


Thus, sir:

Although this lord of weak remembrance, this

Who shall be of as little memory

When he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,—

For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only

Professes to persuade,—the King his son’s alive,

’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d

As he that sleeps here swims.

That he’s undrown’d.


, out of that “no hope”

What great hope have you! No hope that way is

Another way so high a hope, that even

Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,

But doubts discovery there. Will you grant with me

That Ferdinand is drown’d?


He’s gone.


Then tell me,

Who’s the next heir of Naples?


Claribel.


She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells

Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples

Can have no note, unless the sun were post—

The Man i’ th’ Moon’s too slow—till newborn chins

Be rough and razorable; she that from whom

We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,

And by that destiny, to perform an act

Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come

In yours and my discharge.


What stuff is this! How say you?

’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis;

So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions

There is some space.


space whose ev’ry cubit

Seems to cry out “How shall that Claribel

Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,

And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death

Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples

As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate

Methinks  do.


And how does your content

You did supplant your brother Prospero.


True.

And look how well my garments sit upon me;

Much feater than before; my brother’s servants

Were then my fellows; now they are my men.


But, for your conscience.


Ay, sir; where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,

’Twould put me to my slipper: but  feel not

This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences

That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they

And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,

No better than the earth he lies upon,

If he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead;

Whom , with this obedient steel, three inches of it,

Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,

To the perpetual wink for aye might put

This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who

Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,

They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.

They’ll tell the clock to any business that

We say befits the hour.


Thy case, dear friend,

Shall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan,

’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke

Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,

And  the King shall love thee.


Draw together,

And when  rear my hand, do you the like,

To fall it on Gonzalo.

Music. Re-enter Ariel, invisible.


My master through his art foresees the dange
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth—

For else his project dies—to keep them living.


_While you here do snoring lie,

Open-ey’d conspiracy

His time doth take.

If of life you keep a care,

Shake off slumber, and beware.

Awake! awake!_


Then let us both be sudden.


Now, good angels

Preserve the King!



Why, how now! Ho, awake! Why are you drawn?

Wherefore this ghastly looking?


What’s the matter?


Whiles we stood here securing your repose,

Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing

Like bulls, or rather lions; did ’t not wake you?

It struck mine ear most terribly.

! ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,

To make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roa
Of a whole herd of lions.


Heard you this, Gonzalo?


Upon mine honour, sir,  heard a humming,

And that a strange one too, which did awake me.

shak’d you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open’d,

saw their weapons drawn:—there was a noise,

That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,

Or that we quit this place: let’s draw our weapons.


Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search

For my poor son.


Heavens keep him from these beasts!

For he is, sure, i’ th’ island.


Lead away.



Prospero my lord shall know what  have done:

So, King, go safely on to seek thy son.


Another part of the island.



All the infections that the sun sucks up

From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him

By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,

And yet  needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,

Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ the mire,

Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark

Out of my way, unless he bid ’em; but

For every trifle are they set upon me,

Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,

And after bite me; then like hedgehogs which

Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount

Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am 

All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues

Do hiss me into madness.


Lo, now, lo!

Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me

For bringing wood in slowly. ’ll fall flat;

Perchance he will not mind me.


Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all, and

another storm brewing;  hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black

cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his

liquor. If it should thunder as it did before,  know not where to hide

my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have

we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive?  fish: he smells like a fish;

a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest

Poor-John.  strange fish! Were  in England now, as once  was, and

had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a

piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast

there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame

beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg’d like a man,

and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth!  do now let loose my

opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath

lately suffered by thunderbolt.  Alas, the storm is come

again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no othe
shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. 

will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.



_I shall no more to sea, to sea,

Here shall  die ashore—_

This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.

Well, here’s my comfort.


_The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and ,

The gunner, and his mate,

Lov’d Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,

But none of us car’d for Kate:

For she had a tongue with a tang,

Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!”

She lov’d not the savour of tar nor of pitch,

Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.

Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang._

This is a scurvy tune too: but here’s my comfort.



Do not torment me: !


What’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon ’s with

savages and men of Ind? Ha?  have not scap’d drowning, to be afeard

now of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as eve
went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so

again, while Stephano breathes at’ nostrils.


The spirit torments me: !


This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as 

take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language?  will

give him some relief, if it be but for that. If  can recover him and

keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any

emperor that ever trod on neat’s-leather.


Do not torment me, prithee; ’ll bring my wood home faster.


He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste

of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to

remove his fit. If  can recover him, and keep him tame,  will not

take too much for him. He shall pay for him that hath him, and that

soundly.


Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,

know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.


Come on your ways. Open your mouth; here is that which will give

language to you, cat. Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, 

can tell you, and that soundly.  You cannot

tell who’s your friend: open your chaps again.

devils. , defend me!


Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice

now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul

speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him,

will help his ague. Come. Amen!  will pour some in thy other mouth.


Stephano!


Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy! mercy!

This is a devil, and no monster:  will leave him; 

have no long spoon.


Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for  am

thou cam’st hither— escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors

not earthly.

Chiefly that  might set it in my prayers—

Admir’d Miranda!

Indeed, the top of admiration; worth

And put it to the foil: but you,  you,

So perfect and so peerless, are created

Of every creature’s best.

Servant-monster! The folly of this island! They say there’s but five

upon this isle; we are three of them; if th’ other two be brained like

Where should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed, if they

Thou liest, most ignorant monster:  am in case to justle a constable.

Why, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath

drunk so much sack as  today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being

but half a fish and half a monster?


Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?


“Lord” quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!


Lo, lo again! bite him to death,  prithee.

his cunning hath cheated me of the island.


Thou liest.

do not lie.


Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in his tale, by this hand,  will

supplant some of your teeth.


Why,  said nothing.


Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.

From me he got it. If thy greatness will,

Revenge it on him,—for  know thou dar’st;

How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party?


Yea, yea, my lord: ’ll yield him thee asleep,

Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.


Thou liest. Thou canst not.


What a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!

do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,

And take his bottle from him: when that’s gone

He shall drink nought but brine; for ’ll not show him

Where the quick freshes are.


Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word

further, and by this hand, ’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors, and make a

stock-fish of thee.


Why, what did ?  did nothing. ’ll go farther off.


Didst thou not say he lied?


Thou liest.


Do  so? Take thou that.

’ll beat him too.


Stand farther.—Come, proceed.

Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remembe
First to possess his books; for without them

He’s but a sot, as  am, nor hath not

One spirit to command: they all do hate him

As rootedly as . Burn but his books.

He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them,—

Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.

And that most deeply to consider is

The beauty of his daughter; he himself

Calls her a nonpareil:  never saw a woman

But only Sycorax my dam and she;

But she as far surpasseth Sycorax

As great’st does least.


Is it so brave a lass?


Ay, lord, she will become thy bed,  warrant,

And bring thee forth brave brood.


Monster,  will kill this man. His daughter and  will be king and

queen,—save our graces!—and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.

Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?


Excellent.


Give me thy hand:  am sorry  beat thee; but while thou liv’st, keep a

good tongue in thy head.


Within this half hour will he be asleep.

Wilt thou destroy him then?


Ay, on mine honour.


This will  tell my master.


Thou mak’st me merry.  am full of pleasure.

Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch

You taught me but while-ere?


At thy request, monster,  will do reason, any reason. Come on,

Trinculo, let us sing.


_Flout ’em and cout ’em,

and scout ’em and flout ’em:

Thought is free._


That’s not the tune.



What is this same?


This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.


If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou beest a

devil, take ’t as thou list.


, forgive me my sins!


He that dies pays all debts:  defy thee. Mercy upon us!


Art thou afeard?


No, monster, not .


Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,

Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.

Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments

Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,

That, if  then had wak’d after long sleep,

Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,

The clouds methought would open and show riches

Ready to drop upon me; that, when  wak’d,

cried to dream again.


This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where  shall have my music fo
nothing.


When Prospero is destroyed.


That shall be by and by:  remember the story.


The sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and after do our work.


Lead, monster: we’ll follow.  would  could see this taborer! he lays

it on. Wilt come?


’ll follow, Stephano.


Another part of the island.



By ’r lakin,  can go no further, sir;

My old bones ache: here’s a maze trod, indeed,

Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,

needs must rest me.


Old lord,  cannot blame thee,

Who am myself attach’d with weariness

To th’ dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.

Even here  will put off my hope, and keep it

No longer for my flatterer: he is drown’d

Whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks

Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.


am right glad that he’s

so out of hope.

Do not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose

That you resolv’d to effect.


The next advantage

Let it be tonight;

For, now they are oppress’d with travel, they

Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance

As when they are fresh.

actions of salutation; and inviting the King &c., to eat, they depart.


What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!


Marvellous sweet music!

That there are unicorns; that in Arabia

There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne; one phoenix

At this hour reigning there.


’ll believe both;

And what does else want credit, come to me,

And ’ll be sworn ’tis true: travellers ne’er did lie,

Though fools at home condemn them.


If in Naples

should report this now, would they believe me?

If  should say,  saw such islanders,—

For, certes, these are people of the island,—

Who, though, they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,

Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of

Our human generation you shall find

Many, nay, almost any.


Honest lord,

Thou hast said well; for some of you there present

Are worse than devils.

Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing—

Although they want the use of tongue—a kind

Of excellent dumb discourse.


Praise in departing.


They vanish’d strangely.


No matter, since

They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.—

Will’t please you taste of what is here?


Not .


Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,

Who would believe that there were mountaineers

Dewlapp’d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em

Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men

Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find

Each putter-out of five for one will bring us

Good warrant of.

You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,

That hath to instrument this lower world

And what is in’t,—the never-surfeited sea

Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island

Where man doth not inhabit; you ’mongst men

Being most unfit to live.  have made you mad;

And even with such-like valour men hang and drown

Their proper selves.


You fools!  and my fellows

Are ministers of Fate: the elements

Of whom your swords are temper’d may as well

Wound the loud winds, or with bemock’d-at stabs

Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish

One dowle that’s in my plume. My fellow-ministers

Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,

Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,

And will not be uplifted. But, remember—

For that’s my business to you,—that you three

From Milan did supplant good Prospero;

Expos’d unto the sea, which hath requit it,

Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed

The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have

Incens’d the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,

Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,

They have bereft; and do pronounce, by me

Ling’ring perdition,—worse than any death

Can be at once,—shall step by step attend

You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from—

Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls

Upon your heads,—is nothing but heart-sorrow,

And a clear life ensuing.

[_He vanishes in thunder: then, to soft music, enter the Shapes again,

and dance, with mocks and mows, and carry out the table._]


Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou

Perform’d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring.

Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated

In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life

And observation strange, my meaner ministers

Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,

And these mine enemies are all knit up

In their distractions; they now are in my power;

And in these fits  leave them, while  visit

Young Ferdinand,—whom they suppose is drown’d,—

And his and mine lov’d darling.



’ the name of something holy, sir, why stand you

In this strange stare?


, it is monstrous! monstrous!

Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;

The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,

That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounc’d

The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.

Therefore my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded; and

’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,

And with him there lie mudded.



But one fiend at a time,

’ll fight their legions o’er.


’ll be thy second.



All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,

Like poison given to work a great time after,

Now ’gins to bite the spirits.  do beseech you

That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly

And hinder them from what this ecstasy

May now provoke them to.


Follow,  pray you.

If  have too austerely punish’d you,

Your compensation makes amends: fo
Have given you here a third of mine own life,

Or that for which  live; who once again

Were but my trials of thy love, and thou

Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,

ratify this my rich gift.  Ferdinand,

Do not smile at me that  boast her off,

For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,

And make it halt behind her.


do believe it

Against an oracle.


Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition

Worthily purchas’d, take my daughter: but

If thou dost break her virgin knot before

All sanctimonious ceremonies may

With full and holy rite be minister’d,

No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall

To make this contract grow; but barren hate,

Sour-ey’d disdain, and discord shall bestrew

The union of your bed with weeds so loathly

That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,

As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.


As  hope

For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,

With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,

The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion

Our worser genius can, shall never melt

Mine honour into lust, to take away

The edge of that day’s celebration,

When  shall think, or Phoebus’ steeds are founder’d,

Or Night kept chain’d below.


Fairly spoke:

Sit, then, and talk with her, she is thine own.

What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!



What would my potent master? here  am.


Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service

Did worthily perform; and  must use you

In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,

’er whom  give thee power, here to this place.

Incite them to quick motion; for  must

Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple

Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,

And they expect it from me.


Presently?


Ay, with a twink.


Before you can say “Come” and “Go,”

And breathe twice, and cry “so, so,”

Each one, tripping on his toe,

Will be here with mop and mow.

Do you love me, master? no?


Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach

Till thou dost hear me call.


Well,  conceive.



Look thou be true; do not give dalliance

Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw

To th’ fire i’ the blood: be more abstemious,

Or else good night your vow!


warrant you, sir;

The white cold virgin snow upon my heart

Abates the ardour of my liver.


Well.

Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,

Rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly.

No tongue! all eyes! be silent.




Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas

Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;

Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,

And flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep;

Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,

Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,

To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,

Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,

Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;

And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,

Where thou thyself dost air: the Queen o’ th’ sky,

Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am ,

Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,

Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,

To come and sport; her peacocks fly amain:

Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.



Hail, many-colour’d messenger, that ne’e
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;

Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers

Diffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;

And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown

My bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down,

Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen

Summon’d me hither to this short-grass’d green?

And some donation freely to estate

On the blest lovers.


Tell me, heavenly bow,

If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,

Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot

The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,

Her and her blind boy’s scandal’d company

have forsworn.


Of her society

Be not afraid.  met her deity

Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son

Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done

Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,

Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid

Till Hymen’s torch be lighted; but in vain.

Mars’s hot minion is return’d again;

Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,

Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,

And be a boy right out.


Highest queen of State,

Great Juno comes;  know her by her gait.



How does my bounteous sister? Go with me

To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,

And honour’d in their issue.



_Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,

Long continuance, and increasing,

Hourly joys be still upon you!

Juno sings her blessings on you._


_Earth’s increase, foison plenty,

Barns and garners never empty;

Vines with clust’ring bunches growing;

Plants with goodly burden bowing;

Spring come to you at the farthest

In the very end of harvest!

Scarcity and want shall shun you;

Ceres’ blessing so is on you._


This is a most majestic vision, and

Harmonious charmingly. May  be bold

To think these spirits?


Spirits, which by mine art

have from their confines call’d to enact

My present fancies.


Let me live here ever.

So rare a wonder’d father and a wise,

Makes this place Paradise.



Sweet now, silence!

Juno and Ceres whisper seriously,

There’s something else to do: hush, and be mute,

Or else our spell is marr’d.


You nymphs, call’d Naiads, of the windring brooks,

With your sedg’d crowns and ever-harmless looks,

Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land

Answer your summons; Juno does command.

Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate

contract of true love. Be not too late.


You sun-burn’d sicklemen, of August weary,

Come hither from the furrow, and be merry:

Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,

And these fresh nymphs encounter every one

In country footing.

and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise,

they heavily vanish.

Of the beast Caliban and his confederates

Against my life: the minute of their plot

Is almost come.  Well done! avoid; no

more!


This is strange: your father’s in some passion

That works him strongly.


Never till this day

Saw  him touch’d with anger so distemper’d.


You do look, my son, in a mov’d sort,

As if you were dismay’d: be cheerful, sir:

Our revels now are ended. These our actors,

As  foretold you, were all spirits and

Are melted into air, into thin air:

And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,

The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,

The solemn temples, the great globe itself,

Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,

And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,

Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff

As dreams are made on, and our little life

Is rounded with a sleep. Sir,  am vex’d:

Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled.

Be not disturb’d with my infirmity.

If you be pleas’d, retire into my cell

And there repose: a turn or two ’ll walk,

To still my beating mind.

We wish your peace.



Come, with a thought.  thank thee, Ariel. Come!



Thy thoughts  cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?


Spirit,

We must prepare to meet with Caliban.


Ay, my commander. When  presented Ceres,

thought to have told thee of it; but  fear’d

Lest  might anger thee.


Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?

So full of valour that they smote the ai
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground

For kissing of their feet; yet always bending

Towards their project. Then  beat my tabor;

At which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears,

Advanc’d their eyelids, lifted up their noses

As they smelt music: so  charm’d their ears,

That calf-like they my lowing follow’d through

Tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,

Which enter’d their frail shins: at last  left them

’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,

There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake

’erstunk their feet.


This was well done, my bird.

The trumpery in my house, go bring it hithe
For stale to catch these thieves.

Thou wert but a lost monster.


Good my lord, give me thy favour still.

Be patient, for the prize ’ll bring thee to

There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an

infinite loss.

Prithee, my King, be quiet. Seest thou here,

This is the mouth o’ th’ cell: no noise, and enter.

Do that good mischief which may make this island

Thine own for ever, and , thy Caliban,

For aye thy foot-licker.


Give me thy hand.  do begin to have bloody thoughts.


King Stephano!  peer!  worthy Stephano!

Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!


Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, ’ll have that gown.


Thy Grace shall have it.


The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean

To dote thus on such luggage? Let’t alone,

And do the murder first. If he awake,

From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,

Make us strange stuff.


Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the

jerkin under the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and

prove a bald jerkin.


Do, do: we steal by line and level, an’t like your Grace.

And this.


Ay, and this.

Hey, Mountain, hey!


Silver! there it goes, Silver!


Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! hark, hark!


Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints

With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews

With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them

Hark, they roar.


Let them be hunted soundly. At this hou

When first  rais’d the tempest. Say, my spirit,

How fares the King and ’s followers?


Confin’d togethe
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,

Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,

In the line grove which weather-fends your cell;

They cannot budge till your release. The King,

His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,

And the remainder mourning over them,

Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly

Him you term’d, sir, “the good old lord, Gonzalo”.

His tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops

From eaves of reeds; your charm so strongly works ’em,

That if you now beheld them, your affections

Would become tender.


Dost thou think so, spirit?


Mine would, sir, were  human.


And mine shall.

Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling

Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,

One of their kind, that relish all as sharply

Passion as they, be kindlier mov’d than thou art?

Though with their high wrongs  am struck to th’ quick,

Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury

Do  take part: the rarer action is

In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,

The sole drift of my purpose doth extend

Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel.

My charms ’ll break, their senses ’ll restore,

And they shall be themselves.

Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and

groves;

And ye that on the sands with printless foot

Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him

When he comes back; you demi-puppets that

By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,

Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime

Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice

To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,

Weak masters though ye be,  have bedimm’d

The noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds,

And ’twixt the green sea and the azur’d vault

Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunde
Have  given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak

With his own bolt; the strong-bas’d promontory

Have  made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up

The pine and cedar: graves at my command

Have wak’d their sleepers, op’d, and let ’em forth

By my so potent art. But this rough magic

here abjure; and, when  have requir’d

Some heavenly music,—which even now  do,—

To work mine end upon their senses that

This airy charm is for, ’ll break my staff,

Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,

And deeper than did ever plummet sound

’ll drown my book.

Now useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand,

For you are spell-stopp’d.

Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,

Mine eyes, e’en sociable to the show of thine,

Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;

And as the morning steals upon the night,

Melting the darkness, so their rising senses

To him thou follow’st,  will pay thy graces

Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:

Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.

Thou art pinch’d for ’t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,

You, brother mine, that entertain’d ambition,

Expell’d remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,—

Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,

Would here have kill’d your King;  do forgive thee,

Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding

Begins to swell, and the approaching tide

In a cowslip’s bell  lie;

There  couch when owls do cry.

On the bat’s back  do fly

After summer merrily.

Merrily, merrily shall  live now

Why, that’s my dainty Ariel!  shall miss thee;

But yet thou shalt have freedom; so, so, so.

There shalt thou find the mariners asleep

Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain

Or ere your pulse twice beat.



All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement

Out of this fearful country!


Behold, sir King,

The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.

For more assurance that a living prince

Does now speak to thee,  embrace thy body;

And to thee and thy company  bid

hearty welcome.


Whe’er thou be’st he or no,

Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,

As late  have been,  not know: thy pulse

Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since  saw thee,

Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which,

fear, a madness held me: this must crave,

An if this be at all, a most strange story.

Thy dukedom  resign, and do entreat

Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero

Be living and be here?


First, noble friend,

Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot

Be measur’d or confin’d.


Whether this be

Or be not, ’ll not swear.


You do yet taste

Some subtleties o’ the isle, that will not let you

Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all.

But you, my brace of lords, were 

so minded,

here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you,

And justify you traitors: at this time

will tell no tales.


The devil speaks in him.


No.

For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brothe
Would even infect my mouth,  do forgive

Thy rankest fault, all of them; and require

My dukedom of thee, which perforce  know

Thou must restore.


If thou beest Prospero,

Give us particulars of thy preservation;

How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since

Were wrack’d upon this shore; where  have lost,—

How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—

In this last tempest.  perceive, these lords

At this encounter do so much admire

That they devour their reason, and scarce think

Are natural breath; but, howsoe’er you have

Been justled from your senses, know for certain

Upon this shore, where you were wrack’d, was landed

Sir, she is mortal;

But by immortal Providence she’s mine.

chose her when  could not ask my fathe
For his advice, nor thought  had one. She

Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,

Of whom so often  have heard renown,

But never saw before; of whom  have

Receiv’d a second life; and second fathe
This lady makes him to me.

But, , how oddly will it sound that 

Must ask my child forgiveness!


There, sir, stop:

Let us not burden our remembrances with

heaviness that’s gone.

Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,

And on this couple drop a blessed crown;

For it is you that have chalk’d forth the way

Which brought us hither.


say, Amen, Gonzalo!


Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue

Should become Kings of Naples? , rejoice

Beyond a common joy, and set it down

With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage

Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,

And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife

Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom

In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves,

When no man was his own.


Give me your hands:

Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart

That doth not wish you joy!


Be it so. Amen!

Re-enter Ariel with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.

look, sir, look, sir! Here are more of us.

prophesied, if a gallows were on land,

This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,

That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?

Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?


The best news is that we have safely found

Our King and company. The next, our ship,—

Which but three glasses since, we gave out split,

Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg’d as when

We first put out to sea.


Sir, all this service

Have  done since  went.


My tricksy spirit!


These are not natural events; they strengthen

From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?


If  did think, sir,  were well awake,

’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,

And,—how, we know not,—all clapp’d under hatches,

Where, but even now, with strange and several noises

Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,

And mo diversity of sounds, all horrible,

We were awak’d; straightway, at liberty:

Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld

Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our maste
Cap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,

Even in a dream, were we divided from them,

And were brought moping hither.


Was’t well done?


Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.


This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod;

And there is in this business more than nature

Was ever conduct of: some oracle

Must rectify our knowledge.


Sir, my liege,

Do not infest your mind with beating on

The strangeness of this business. At pick’d leisure,

Which shall be shortly, single ’ll resolve you,

Which to you shall seem probable, of every

These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful

And think of each thing well.  Come hither, spirit;

Set Caliban and his companions free;

Untie the spell.


How fares my gracious sir?

There are yet missing of your company

Some few odd lads that you remember not.

Re-enter Ariel driving in Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo in thei
stolen apparel.


Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself,

for all is but fortune.—Coragio! bully-monster, coragio!


If these be true spies which  wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.


Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed.

How fine my master is!  am afraid

He will chastise me.


Ha, ha!

What things are these, my lord Antonio?

Will money buy them?


Very like; one of them

Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.


Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,

Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,

His mother was a witch; and one so strong

That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,

And deal in her command without her power.

These three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil,

For he’s a bastard one, had plotted with them

To take my life. Two of these fellows you

Must know and own; this thing of darkness 

Acknowledge mine.


shall be pinch’d to death.


Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?


He is drunk now: where had he wine?


And Trinculo is reeling-ripe: where should they

Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?

How cam’st thou in this pickle?


have been in such a pickle since  saw you last that,  fear me, will

never out of my bones.  shall not fear fly-blowing.


Why, how now, Stephano!


! touch me not.  am not Stephano, but a cramp.


You’d be King o’ the isle, sirrah?


should have been a sore one, then.


This is as strange a thing as e’er  look’d on.



He is as disproportioned in his manners

As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;

Take with you your companions. As you look

To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.


Ay, that  will; and ’ll be wise hereafter,

And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass

Was , to take this drunkard for a god,

And worship this dull fool!


Go to; away!


Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.


Or stole it, rather.



Sir,  invite your Highness and your train

To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest

For this one night; which, part of it, ’ll waste

With such discourse as,  not doubt, shall make it

Go quick away: the story of my life

And the particular accidents gone by

Since  came to this isle: and in the morn

’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,

Where  have hope to see the nuptial

Of these our dear-belov’d solemnized;

And thence retire me to my Milan, where

Every third thought shall be my grave.

To hear the story of your life, which must

Take the ear strangely.


’ll deliver all;

And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,

And sail so expeditious that shall catch

Your royal fleet far off.  My Ariel,

chick,

That is thy charge: then to the elements

Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.




Now my charms are all o’erthrown,

And what strength  have’s mine own,

Which is most faint. Now ’tis true,

must be here confin’d by you,

Or sent to Naples. Let me not,

Since  have my dukedom got,

And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell

In this bare island by your spell,

But release me from my bands

With the help of your good hands.

Gentle breath of yours my sails

Must fill, or else my project fails,

Which was to please. Now  want

Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;

And my ending is despair,

Unless  be reliev’d by prayer,

Which pierces so that it assaults

Mercy itself, and frees all faults.

As you from crimes would pardon’d be,

Let your indulgence set me free.
